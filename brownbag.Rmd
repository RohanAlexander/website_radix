*An hour-long discussion about cleaning, preparing, and maintaining data in academia and industry. All welcome! If you would like to receive emails about the series please [get in touch](mailto:rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca).*

**Overview**

In any data science project a lot of time is spent on data cleaning, preparation, and maintenance, but these steps are rarely talked about, let alone written down. This means that there is a lot of reinvention and it can be difficult to know what best practice is. To help address this [Rohan Alexander](https://rohanalexander.com/) and [Prof Kelly Lyons](http://individual.utoronto.ca/klyons/) run a multidisciplinary brown bag that focuses on data cleaning. The series is a chance to share what we do in these crucial, yet little discussed, stages.

We meet for an hour roughly every two weeks and we aim to have a roughly even split of speakers from academia and industry over the course of the semester. Usually each speaker talks for 15 to 25 minutes and we then have a bit of time for questions.

Anyone is welcome to attend - you don't need to be affiliated with the university.
