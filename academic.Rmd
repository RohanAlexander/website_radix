### Education

#### Australian National University

* Ph.D. Economics (2015--*current*)  
My research focuses on Australian political and economic history, such as exploring: the impact of various events on discussion in state and federal parliaments; who voted for Federation; and which politicians get an incumbency effect. My panel is [John Tang](https://sites.google.com/site/jptang/) (primary supervisor), [Martine Mariotti](https://www.cbe.anu.edu.au/about/staff-directory/?profile=Martine-Mariotti) (chair), [Zach Ward](https://sites.google.com/site/zachaward/) and [Tim Hatton](https://sites.google.com/site/timhattonwebsite/).
* M.Economics (2012)

#### University of Queensland

* B.Economics (Hons) (2004-2008)  
I wrote an honours thesis in game theory supervised by [Rabee Tourky](http://tourky.org/) and was a research assistant to: [Flavio Menezes](https://economics.uq.edu.au/profile/2324/flavio-menezes) on a project about ACCC decisions; and [Liam Wagner](http://www.liamwagner.com/) on a project about energy prices.
