Hi, Iâ€™m Rohan Alexander.

I am a post-doc at the Faculty of Information Sciences at the University of Toronto, Canada. My research explores economic and political history using quantitative methods. This often involves first constructing datasets, either though optical character recognition or web-scraping, and then cleaning and preparing them in a reproducible way. I run a brown-bag series about data cleaning, which is more fun than it sounds; please get in touch if you'd like to attend or present!

I apply my academic research to run a politicial poll in Australia: [Petit Poll](https://petitpoll.com). This combines non-representative polling data that we gather ourselves with a hierarchical Bayesian model to cheaply deliver meaningful Australian political polling.

Finally, I probably spend too much money on books, and certainly too much time at libraries. You can see some of the books that I recommend [here](https://rohanalexander.com/bookshelf.html). If you have any book recommendations of your own, I've love to hear them.
