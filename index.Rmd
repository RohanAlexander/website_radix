Hi, I'm Rohan Alexander.

I'm a PhD student at the  Australian National University in Canberra where I explore Australian economic and political history using quantitative methods. 

I work on a casual basis as a consultant at Grosvenor Public Sector Advisory on public-sector procurement data. On the side I work on Petit Poll and No Pour Choices.
