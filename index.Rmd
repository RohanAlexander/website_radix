Hi, Iâ€™m Rohan Alexander.

I am a post-doc at the Faculty of Information Sciences at the University of Toronto, Canada. My [academic research](https://rohanalexander.com/academic.html) explores economic and political history using quantitative methods. This often involves first constructing datasets, either through optical character recognition or web-scraping, as well as cleaning and preparing them in a reproducible way. I then use quantitative methods to analyse the large amounts of information contained in these datasets, drawing on techniques from text analysis, statistical learning, and Bayesian methods. 

I run a [brown bag series](https://rohanalexander.com/brownbag.html) about data cleaning, which is more fun than it sounds; please [get in touch](mailto:rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca) if you'd like to attend or present!

Based on my academic research I run a politicial poll in Australia: [Petit Poll](https://petitpoll.com). This combines non-representative polling data that we gather ourselves with a hierarchical Bayesian model to cheaply deliver meaningful Australian political polling.

Finally, I probably spend too much money on books, and certainly too much time at libraries. You can see some of the books that I recommend [here](https://rohanalexander.com/bookshelf.html). If you have any book recommendations of your own, I've love to hear them.
