#### University of Toronto
* Instructor, Experimental Design for Data Science, Faculty of Information, Winter Term, 2020.
  - In this class students learned how to tell stories with data and quantitative analysis. They learned how to gather data, develop questions, answer those questions using quantitative methods, and communicate their answers. This was a hands-on course in which students used R and real-world datasets. The class focused on what to do when traditional experimental design methods cannot be implemented or are not appropriate. And the extent to which those allow us to speak to causality even when we cannot conduct traditional experiments.
