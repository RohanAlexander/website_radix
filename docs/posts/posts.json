    "description": "SQL is a popular way of working with data. Advanced users probably do a lot with it alone, but even just having a working knowledge of SQL has increased the number of datasets that I can get data from to then analyse with other tools such as R or Python. You can use SQL within RStudio if you want. The following are a few notes to help future-Rohan when he needs to use SQL. A worked example with a sample of the Hansard data will be included in a future post.",

One way to get consistent estimates of the topics of each statement in Hansard is to use the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method of Blei, Ng, Jordan, @Blei2003latent, as implemented by the R package 'topicmodels' by Grun @Grun2011.",
