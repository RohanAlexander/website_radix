Rohan Alexander Last updated 12 March 2020 Chapter 1 Overview 1.1 On telling stories Like many parents, when our child was born, one of the first things that my wife and I did regularly was read stories to him. In doing so we carried on a tradition that has occurred for millennia. Myths, fables, and fairy tales can be seen and heard all around us. Not only are they entertaining but they enable us to easily learn something about the world. While ‘The Very Hungry Caterpillar’ may seem quite far from the world of quantitative analysis, there are similarities. Both are trying to tell the reader a story. When conducting quantitative analysis we are trying to tell the reader a story that will convince them of something. It may be as exciting as predicting elections, as banal as increasing internet advertising click rates by 0.01 per cent, as serious as finding the cause of some disease, or as fun as forecasting the winner of a basketball game. In any case the key elements are the same. When writing fiction Wikipedia suggests there are five key elements: character, plot, setting, theme, and style. When we are conducting quantitative analysis we have analogous concerns: What is the data? Who generated it and how? What is the data trying to say? How can we let it say this? What is the broader context surrounding the data? Where and when was it generated? Could other data have been generated? What are we hoping others will see from this data? How can you convince them of this? In the past, certain elements of telling stories with quantitative data were easier. For instance, experimental design has a long and robust tradition within traditional applications such as agricultural and medical sciences, physics, and chemistry. Student’s t-distribution was identified by a chemist, William Sealy Gosset, who was working at Guinness and needed to assess the quality of the beer (Tonse Raju 2005)! It would have been possible for him to randomly sample the beer and change one aspect at a time. Indeed, many of the fundamental statistical methods that we use today were developed in an agricultural setting. In the settings for which they were developed it was typically possible to establish control groups, randomize, and easily deal with any ethical concerns. In such a setting any subsequent story that is told with the resulting data is likely to be fairly convincing. Unfortunately, such a set-up is rarely possible in modern data science applications. On the other hand, there are many aspects that are easier today. For instance, we have well-developed statistical techniques, easier access to larger datasets, and open source statistical languages such as R. But the lack of ability to conduct traditional experiments means that we must turn to other aspects in order to tell a reader a convincing story about our data. These other aspects allow us to tell stories about causality even in the absence of a traditional experimental set-up. 1.2 Telling stories with data These notes focus on what to do when traditional experimental design methods cannot be implemented or are not appropriate. The aim is to equip you with everything you need to be able to write short, technical, memos, that convince a reader of the story you are telling. These notes encourage research-based, independent learning. This means that you will develop your own questions and answer them to the extent that you can. We focus on methods that can provide some measure of causality even when we cannot conduct traditional experiments. Importantly, these approaches do not rely on ‘big data’, but instead on better using the data that are available. The purpose of the notes is to allow you to tell convincing stories using data and quantitative analysis. They blend theory, examples, and labs, to equip you to with practical skills, a sophisticated workflow, and an appreciation for how more-advanced methods build on what is covered here. Data science is multi-disciplinary. It takes the ‘best’ bits from fields such as statistics, data visualisation, programming, and experimental design (to name a few). As such, data science projects require a blend of these skills. These are hands-on notes in which you will learn these skills by conducting research projects using real-world data. This means that you will: obtain and clean relevant datasets; develop your own research questions; use statistical techniques to answer those questions; and communicate your results in a meaningful way. These notes were developed in collaboration with professional data scientists as well as academics from a variety of fields. They are designed around approaches that are used extensively in academia, government, and industry. Furthermore, they include many aspects, such as data cleaning and communication, that are critical, but rarely taught. However, these notes do not contain everything that you need. Your learning must be ‘active’ when using these notes because that is the way you will continue to learn through the rest of your life and career. You need to seek out additional information, critically evaluate it, and apply it to your situation. The workflow that we follow in these notes is: Research question development. Data collection. Data cleaning. Exploratory data analysis. Statistical modelling. Evaluation. Communication. Reproduce. All of these aspects are critical to being able to tell convincing stories in an absence of traditional experimental set-ups. Importantly, when you are doing causal analysis, you are trying to convince a reader of your story. Your ability to convince them of your story depends on the quality of all aspects of your workflow. If we were to expand on this workflow then we roughly get the chapters that are covered in these notes. From the first chapter we will have a workflow (make a graph then write about it convincingly) that could allow us to speak to causality. In each subsequent chapter we add aspects and depth to our workflow that will allow us to speak with increasing sophistication and credibility. This workflow also aligns nicely with the skills that are sought in data scientists. For instance, Mango Solutions, a UK data science consultancy, describes ‘the six core capabilities of data scientists’ as: communicator; data-wrangler; programmer; technologist; modeller; and visualiser. 1.3 These notes 1.3.1 Software The software that we use in these notes is R. This language was chosen because it is open-source, widely used, general enough to cover the entire workflow, yet specific enough to have plenty of the tools that we need for statistical analysis built in. We do not assume that you have used R before, and so another reason for selecting R for these notes is the community of R users which is, in general, especially welcoming of new-comers and there are a lot of great beginner-friendly materials available. If you don’t have a programming language, then R is a great one to start with. If you have a preferred programming language already, then it wouldn’t hurt to pick up R as well. That said, if you have a good reason to prefer another open source programming language (for instance you use Python daily at work) then you may wish to stick with that. However, all examples in these notes are in R. Please download R and R Studio onto your own computer. You can download R for free here: http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/, and you can download R Studio Desktop for free here: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. Please also create an account on R Studio Cloud: https://rstudio.cloud/. This will allow you to run R in the cloud, which will be helpful when you are getting started. 1.3.2 Assumed background These notes assume familiarity with first-year statistics. For instance, if you have a taken a course or two where you covered hypothesis testing and similar concepts then that should be enough. 1.3.3 Structure These notes are structured around a 12-week course. Each chapter contains a list of required reading, as well as a list of recommended reading for those who are interested in the topic and want a starting place for further exploration. All chapters contain a summary of the key concepts and skills that are developed in that chapter. Code and technical chapters additionally contain a list of the main packages and functions that are used in the chapter. Each of the main content chapters (as opposed to labs) also has a pre-quiz. This is a short quiz that you should complete after doing the required readings, but before going through the chapter to test your knowledge. After completing the chapter, you should go back through the lists and the pre-quiz to make sure that you understand each aspect. There are five problem sets throughout these notes. These are opportunities for you to conduct your own research on a topic that is of interest to you. Although the initial problem sets require you to use data from the Toronto Open Data Portal (https://open.toronto.ca/), after those first few you are able to use any appropriate dataset. Although open-ended research may be new to you, the extent to which you are able to develop your own questions, use quantitative methods to explore them, and communicate your story to a reader, is the true measure of the success of these notes. 1.4 Acknowledgements Many people gave generously of their time, code, and data to help develop these notes.

What do you see is the role of causality in data science? Imagine that you have a job in which including race as an explanatory variable improves the performance of your model. What types of issues would you consider when deciding whether to include this variable in production? What if the variable was sexuality? What role do you see for reproducibility in data science? How about replicability? 2.1 Introduction This chapter is the basics of using R. Some of it may not make sense at first, but these are commands that we will come back to throughout these notes. You should initially just go through this chapter quickly, noting aspects that you don’t understand. Then start to play around with some of the initial case studies. Then maybe come back to this chapter. That way you will see how the various bits fit into context, and hopefully be more motivated to pick up various aspects. We will come back to everything in this chapter in more detail at some point in these notes. R is an open source language that is useful for statistical programming You can download R for free here: http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/, and you can download R Studio Desktop for free here: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. When you are using R you will run into trouble at some point. To work through that trouble: Look at the help file for the function by putting ? before the function e.g. ?pivot_wider. Check the class of your data, by class(data_set$data_column). Check for typos. Google the error. Google what you are trying to do. Restart R (Session -&gt; Restart R and Clear Output). Try to make a small example and see if you have the same issues. Restart your computer. The general workflow that we will use involves: Import Tidy Transforming, descriptive Plot Model Repeat 3/4 2.2 Tidyverse Tidy data has the following features: each variable has its own column each observation has its own row each value has its own cell Let’s start by reading in some packages that will help (don’t worry too much about what they are doing for now). library(here) library(tidyverse) Here we are going to read in a dataset about age specific mortality by year. mortality_data &lt;- read_table(&quot;inputs/data/CAN_Mx_1x1.txt&quot;, skip = 2) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## Year = col_double(), ## Age = col_character(), ## Female = col_character(), ## Male = col_character(), ## Total = col_character() ## ) mortality_data %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## Year Age Female Male Total ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1921 0 0.105821 0.138250 0.122259 ## 2 1921 1 0.015593 0.017806 0.016710 ## 3 1921 2 0.007409 0.008521 0.007970 ## 4 1921 3 0.005442 0.006111 0.005779 ## 5 1921 4 0.004563 0.004745 0.004655 ## 6 1921 5 0.003433 0.003828 0.003633 How do we get there?

Read it as “and then” (Mac shortcut: Cmd+Shft+M). This takes the output of a line of code and uses it as an input to the next line of code. You don’t have to use it, but it tends to make your code more readable. The idea of the pipe is that you take your dataset and then you do stuff infant_mortality &lt;- read_rds(&quot;inputs/data/infant.RDS&quot;) infant_mortality %&gt;% head() ## # A tibble: 6 x 8 ## sex aged race gest ucod cod mom_age mom_age_group ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 F 0 NHW 27 P832 peri_oth 30 30 ## 2 M 0 NHW 36 Q913 cong_mal 32 30 ## 3 M 8 NHW 44 P360 peri_inf 25 25 ## 4 F 0 NHB 21 P072 peri_comp 29 25 ## 5 M 8 NHB 26 P220 peri_resp 23 20 ## 6 M 17 NHW 39 Q249 cong_mal 34 30 2.2.2 Select Select is selecting a column.

In a similar way to piping, it works in layers. But instead of using the pipe (%&gt;%) ggplot uses +. 2.3.1 Main features data aesthetics / mapping type (geom) Let’s build up a histogram of age of death with increasing complexity. Starts with a grey box: ggplot(data = infant_mortality, mapping = aes(x = aged)) We need to tell it what we want to plot. This is where geom comes in ggplot(data = infant_mortality, mapping = aes(x = aged)) + geom_histogram(fill = &quot;blue&quot;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. Let’s look at the histograms by race. This is an aesthetic. ggplot(data = infant_mortality, mapping = aes(x = aged, fill = race)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5, color = NA) Make it prettier? ggplot(data = infant_mortality, mapping = aes(x = aged, fill = race)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5, color = NA) + labs(x = &quot;Age of deaths (days)&quot;, title = &quot;Density of infant deaths&quot;, subtitle = &quot;because we can&quot;) + theme_bw() Change the color ggplot(data = infant_mortality, mapping = aes(x = aged, fill = cod)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5, color = NA) + labs(x = &quot;Age of deaths (days)&quot;, title = &quot;Density of infant deaths&quot;, subtitle = &quot;because we can&quot;) + theme_bw() + scale_fill_viridis_d() 2.3.2 Facets Facets == subplots ggplot(data = infant_mortality, mapping = aes(x = aged, fill = cod)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5, color = NA) + labs(x = &quot;Age of deaths (days)&quot;, title = &quot;Density of infant deaths&quot;, subtitle = &quot;because we can&quot;) + theme_bw() + scale_fill_viridis_d() + facet_wrap(~race) 2.3.3 Small things You can pipe data into ggplot infant_mortality %&gt;% group_by(cod, race) %&gt;% summarise(n = n()) %&gt;% group_by(race) %&gt;% mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = race, y = prop, fill = cod)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + coord_flip() + scale_fill_viridis_d() 2.4 Other 2.4.1 case_when This graph above has a lot of categories.

Some of the code may be a bit unfamiliar to you if it’s your first time using R. Don’t worry. It’ll all soon be familiar. But the only way to learn how to code is to code. Please try to get this working on your own computer, typing out (not copy/pasting) all the code that you need. One of the great things about graphs and tables is that sometimes this is all you need to have a convincing story (Figures 3.1, 3.2). Figure 3.1: A famous example where a map helped identify the cause of Cholera Source: By John Snow - Published by C.F. Cheffins, Lith, Southhampton Buildings, London, England, 1854 in Snow, John. On the Mode of Communication of Cholera, 2nd Ed, John Churchill, New Burlington Street, London, England, 1855. Figure 3.2: How footballers measure against athletes in major US sports Source: Ganesh, Janan, 2020, ‘Will Liverpool’s machine football conquer America?’, Financial Times, 21 February 2020, available at: https://www.ft.com/content/d61f94ba-53cb-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1, via John Burn-Murdoch. In this case study we are going to focus on making a table and a graph from our data. Although you will be guided thoroughly to achieve this, hopefully by seeing the power of quantitative analysis with R you will be motivated to stick with it when you run into difficulties later on. 3.2 Create a graph based on the 2019 Canadian Federal election 3.2.1 Getting started To get started you should open a new R Markdown file (File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown). As this is our first attempt at using R in the wild, we will just have everything in the one R Markdown document. (In later projects we will move to a more robust set-up.) Then you should create a new R code chunk (command + option + i) and add some preamble documentation. I like to specify the purpose of the document, who the author is and their contact details, when the file was written or last updated, and pre-requisites that the file relies on. You may also like to include a license, and list outstanding issues or todos. Remember that in R, lines that start with ‘#’ are comments - they won’t run. #### Preamble #### # Purpose: Read in voting data from the 2019 Canadian Election and output a # dataset that can be used for analysis. # Author: Rohan Alexander # Email: rohan.alexander@utoronto.ca # Date: 9 January 2019 # Prerequisites: Need the text file from the Canadian elections website # Issues: # To do: After this I typically set-up my workspace. This usually involves installing and/or reading in any packages, and possibly updating them. Remember that you only need to install a package once for each computer. But you need to call it every time you want to use it.

It can be handy when you get a new dataset to quickly come to terms with it. The p0, p25, p50, etc, values that it provides are percentiles. So for instance, P50 is the 50th percentile which means that 50 per cent of the data are below this, and 50 per cent are above i.e. the median. P0 should be the minimum, and p100 should be the maximum. The middle ones are similarly defined, so p25, means that 25 per cent of the data are below this point and 75 per cent of it is above this point. The general idea of both the percentiles and the histogram is to give you a quick idea of how skewed your data is. "],

Key concepts/skills/etc Writing efficiently and effectively is a requirement if you want your work to be convincing. Don’t waste your reader’s time. A good title says what the paper is about, a great title says what the paper found. For a six-page paper, a good abstract is a three to five sentence paragraph. For a longer paper your abstract can be slightly longer. Pre-quiz Please go to the Grattan Institute website and look at the report: ‘No free lunch: Higher super means lower wages’: https://grattan.edu.au/report/no-free-lunch/. Please also download the report itself: https://grattan.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/No-free-lunch-Higher-superannuation-means-lower-wages.pdf. By way of background, superannuation is a scheme whereby the Australian government forces all workers to save for their retirement. It is currently 9.5 per cent of your wage, and it is planned to increase to 12 per cent in a few years. Title: Please read the title of the report. What is good about the title and what could be done better? How many marks would you give the title out of 3? Abstract: Please read the ‘abstract’, which is the main content in the webpage: https://grattan.edu.au/report/no-free-lunch/. What is good about the abstract? What could be done better? What mark would you give them out of 5 and why? Introduction: Turning to the report itself (the PDF), what do you think of the ‘Introduction’ (they call it an ‘Overview’)? What is good about it and what could they have done better? What is the main difference between their ‘abstract’ and their ‘introduction’? What mark would you give them out of 5 and why? Dataset: Please look at pages 21 through to 32 (and any other pages that you need - the appendices may be useful). To what extent have they explained their dataset? Where have they done well? What could have been done better? What mark would you give them out of 10 and why? Model and results: Please look at pages 32 through to 37 (and any other pages that you need - the appendices may be useful) and examine their models and results. Do you understand the model? How could they have done better? Do you understand their results? Again, how could it have been done better? Do you think that they have satisfied the assumptions of the model that they are using? Finally, do you understand the weaknesses of the model? What mark would you give them out of 10 and why? References: Please turn to their references. What is good and bad about it? What mark would you give them out of 3 and why? Typos: Was the report free of any noticeable typos? (Hint: There are at least five.) To what extent does their existence undermine the credibility of the report in your mind? Causality: So, are you convinced by their story? What do you think about the proposed change to superannuation? What mark would you give them out of 5 and why? 4.1 Introduction In order to convince someone of your story papers and reports should be well-written, well-organized, and easy to follow. They should flow easily from one point to the next. They should have proper sentence structure, spelling, vocabulary, and grammar. Each point should be articulated clearly and completely without being overly verbose. Papers should demonstrate your understanding of the topics you are writing about and your confidence in discussing the terms, techniques and issues that are relevant. References must be included and properly cited because this enhances your credibility. People who need to write: founders, VCs, lawyers, software engineers, designers, painters, data scientists, musicians, filmmakers, creative directors, physical trainers, teachers, writers. Learn to write. Sahil Lavingia. This is great advice. Writing well has done just as much for me as knowing how to code. I’d add that if you’re intimidated by writing, start a blog and write often about something you’re interested in. You’ll get better. At least that’s what I’ve done for the past 10 years. :) Vicki Boykis. This chapter is about how to write. By the end of it you will have a better idea of how to write short, detailed, quantitative papers that communicate exactly what you want them to and don’t waste the time of your reader. 4.2 Title, abstract, and introduction A title is the first opportunity that you have to tell the reader your story. Ideally you will tell the reader exactly what you found. An effective title is critical in order to get your work read when there are other competing priorities. A title doesn’t have to be ‘cute’ to be great. Good: ‘On the 2019 Canadian Federal Election’. (At least the reader knows what the paper is about.) Better: ‘The Liberal Party performance in the 2019 Canadian Federal Election’. (At least the reader knows what the paper is about more specifically.) Even better: ‘The Liberal Party did poorly in rural areas in the 2019 Canadian Federal Election’. (The reader knows what the paper is about.) You should put your name and the date on the paper because this provides an important context to the paper. For a six-page paper, a good abstract is a three to five sentence paragraph. For a longer paper your abstract can be slightly longer. The abstract should say: What you did, what you found, and why the reader should care. Each of these should just be a sentence or two, so keep it very high level. You should then have an introduction that tells the reader everything they need to know. You are not writing a mystery story - tell the reader the most important points in the introduction. For a six-page paper, your introduction may be a paragraph or two. Three would likely be too much, but it depends on the context. Your introduction should set the scene and give the reader some background. For instance, you may like to start of a little broader, to provide some context to your paper. You should then describe how your paper fits into that context. Then give some high-level results - provide more detail than you provided in the abstract, but don’t get into the weeds - and finally broadly discuss next steps or glaring weaknesses. With regard to that high-level result: you need to pick one. If you have a bunch of interesting findings, then good for you, but pick one and write your introduction around that. If it’s compelling enough then the reader will end up reading all your other interesting findings in the discussion/results sections. As an example: (TODO: this is just made up, update with something that is factual) The Canadian Liberal Party has always struggled in rural ridings. In the past 100 years they have never won more than 25 per cent of them. But even by those standards the 2019 Federal Election was a disappointment with the Liberal Party winning only 2 of the 40 rural ridings. In this paper we look at why the performance of the Liberal Party in this most recent election was so poor. We construct a model in which whether the Liberal Party won the riding is explained by the number of farms in the riding, the average internet connectivity, and the median age. We find that as the median age of a riding increases, the likelihood that a riding was won by the Liberal Party decreases by 14 percentage points. Future work could expand the time horizon that is considered which would allow a more nuanced understanding of these effects. The recommended readings provide some lovely examples of titles, abstracts, and introductions. Please take the time to briefly read these papers. 4.3 Figures, tables, equations, and technical terms Figure and tables are a critical aspect of convincing people of your story. In a graph you can show your data and then let people decide for themselves. And in a table you can more easily summarise your data. Figures, tables, equations, etc, should be numbered and then referenced in the text e.g. “Figure 1 shows…” and then have Figure 1. You should make sure that all aspects of your graph are legible. Always label all of the axes. Your graphs should have titles, and the point that you want to communicate should be clear. If you use a technical term, then it should be briefly explained in plain language for readers who might not be familiar with it. A great example of this is this post by Monica Alexander where she explains the Gini coefficient: To look at the concentration of baby names, let’s calculate the Gini coefficient for each country, sex and year. The Gini coefficient measures dispersion or inequality among values of a frequency distribution. It can take any value between 0 and 1. In the case of income distributions, a Gini coefficient of 1 would mean one person has all the income. In this case, a Gini coefficient of 1 would mean that all babies have the same name. In contrast, a Gini coefficient of 0 would mean names are evenly distributed across all babies. 4.4 On brevity Figure 4.1: ‘No more than four pages, or he’s never going to read it. Two pages is preferable.’ Source: Shipman, Tim, 2020, &quot;The prime minister’s vanishing briefs’, The Sunday Times, 23 February, available at: https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-prime-ministers-vanishing-briefs-67mt0bg95 via Sarah Nickson. Insisting on two page briefs is sensible - not ‘government by ADHD’. PM has to be across lots of issues - cannot and should not be across (most of) them in the same depth as secretaries of state. Danger lies in PM trying to take on too much and getting bogged down in detail. This might irk officials who lack a sense of where their issue sits within the PM’s list of priorities - or the writing skills to draft a succinct brief. But there’d be very few occasions when a brief to the PM warrants more than two pages. This is not something peculiar to the current PM - other ministers have raised the same in interviews with @instituteforgov Oliver Letwin complained of ‘huge amount of terrible guff, at huge, colossal, humungous length coming from some departments’ https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/ministers-reflect/person/oliver-letwin/ Letwin sent briefs back and asked they be re-drafted to one quarter of the length. ‘Somewhere along the line the Civil Service had got used to splurge of the meaningless kind’ Similarly, Theresa Villiers talked about the civil service’s ‘frustrating tendency to produce six pages of obscure and rather impenetrable text’ and wishes she’d be firmer in sending documents back for re-drafting: https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/ministers-reflect/person/theresa-villiers/ Sarah Nickson, 23 Feb 2020. Brevity is important. Partly this because you are writing for the reader, not yourself, and your reader has other priorities. But it is also because as the writer it focuses you to consider what your most important points are, how you can best support them, and where your arguments are weakest. If you don’t think that examples from government are persuasive, then please consider Amazon’s 2017 Letter to Shareholders, or other statements about Bezos and memo writing, for instance: Well structured, narrative text is what we’re after rather than just text… The reason writing a 4 page memo is harder than “writing” a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what’s more important than what, and how things are related. Jeff Bezos, 9 June 2004. 4.5 Other Typos and other grammatical mistakes affect the credibility of your claims. If the reader can’t trust you to use a spell-checker then why should they trust you to use logistic regression? Microsoft Word has a fantastic spell-checker that is much better than what is available for R Markdown: copy/paste your work into there, look for the red lines and fix them in your R Markdown. Then look for the green lines and think about if you need to fix them in your R Markdown. If you don’t have Word then Google Docs is pretty good and so is Apple’s Pages. A few other general tips that I have stolen from various people including the Reserve Bank of Australia’s style guide: Think about what you are writing. Aim to write everything as though it were on the front page of the newspaper, because one day it could be. Be concise. Remove as many words as possible. Be direct. Think about the structure of your story, and identify the key pieces of information and arrange them so that your paper flows logically from one to the next. You should use sub-headings if you need. Be precise. For instance, the stock-market didn’t improve or worsen, it rose or fell. Distinguish levels from rates of change. Be clear. Write simply. Use short sentence where possible. Avoid jargon. You should break these rules when you need to. But the only way to know whether you need to break a rule is to know the rules in the first instance. "],

Debugging is a skill, and you will get better at it with time and practice. Start with reading the error message. Check the class. You may get frustrated at times, this is normal. There are various tools that can help. Google is your friend. Make a small example and try to get the code running on that. Cultivating a tenacious mentality may help. Write code that future-you can understand. 5.1 Introduction This chapter is what do when your code doesn’t do what you want, discusses a mindset that may help when doing quantitative analysis with R, and finally, some recommendations around how to write your code. 5.2 Getting help Programming is hard and everyone struggles sometimes. At some point your code won’t run or will throw an error. This is normal, and it happens to everyone. It happens to me on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis. Everyone gets frustrated. There are a few steps that are worthwhile taking when this happens: Sometimes the error messages in R are useful. Read it carefully and see if there’s anything of use in it. At the very least, if you get the same message in the future, hopefully you might remember how you solved the problem this time! If you’re getting an error then try googling it, (I find it can help to include the term ‘R’ or ‘tidyverse’ or the relevant package name). If there’s a particular function that seems to be giving trouble, have a look at the help file for it. Sometimes you might be putting in the arguments in the wrong order. You can do this with ‘?function’ e.g. for help with select, you would type ‘?select’ and then run that line. Check the class of the object. Sometimes R is a little fussy and converting the class can help. If your code just isn’t running, then try searching for what you are trying to do, e.g. ‘save PDF of graph in R made using ggplot’. Almost always there are relevant blog posts or Stack Overflow answers that will help. Try to restart R and R Studio and load everything again. Try to restart your computer. There are a few small mistakes that I often make and may be worth checking in case you make them too: check the class e.g. class(my_dataset$its_column) to make sure that is what it should be; when you’re using ggplot make sure you use ‘+’ not ‘%&gt;%’; and check whether you are using ‘.’ when you shouldn’t be, or vice versa. It’s almost always helpful to take a break and come back the next day. Asking for help is a skill that you will get better at, but in general I recomend: Provide an example of your data and what is going wrong. Document what you have tried so far. Document what outcome you would like. 5.3 Mentality (Y)ou are a real, valid, competent user and programmer no matter what IDE you develop in or what tools you use to make your work work for you (L)et’s break down the gates, there’s enough room for everyone Sharla Gelfand, 10 March 2020. I’m a little hesitant to make suggestions with regard to mentality. If you write code, then you’re coder regardless of how you do it, what you’re using it for, or who you are. But I want to share a few traits that I have found have been useful to cultivate in myself. That said, entirely, whatever works for you is great, so take or leave this section. Focused: I’ve found that having an aim to ‘learn R’ or something similar tends to be problematic, because there’s no real end point to that. Instead I would recommend smaller, more specific goals, such as ‘make a histogram about the 2019 Canadian Election with ggplot’. That is something that you can focus on and achieve. With more nebulous goals it becomes easier to get lost on tangents, much more difficult to get help, and I’ve noticed that poeple who have nebulous goals seem to give up. Curious: I’ve found that it’s useful to just have a go. In general, the worst that happens is that you waste your time and have to give up. You can rarely break something irreparably. If you want to know what happens if you pass a vector instead of a dataframe to ggplot then just try it. Pragmatic: At the same time, I’ve found that it’s best to try to stick within the bounds of what I know and just make one small change each time. For instance if you’re wanting to do some regression, and curious about the tidymodels package instead of lm. Perhaps you could just use one aspect from the tidymodels package initially and then make another change next time. Ugly code that gets the job done, is better than beautiful code that doesn’t. Tenacious: This is a balancing act. I always find there are unexpected problems and issues with every project. On the one hand persevering despite these is a good tendency. But on the other hand I’ve learnt that sometimes I need to be prepared to give up on something if it doesn’t seem like a break-through is possible. This is where I have found that mentors can be useful as they tend to have a better idea. This is also where planning comes in. Planned: I have found it is very useful to plan out what you are going to do. For instance, you may want to make a histogram of the 2019 Canadian Election. I find it useful to plan the steps that are needed and even to sketch out how I might implement each step. For instance, the first step is to get the data. What packages might be useful? Where might the data be? What is our back-up plan for if we can’t find the data in that initial spot? Done is better than perfect: We all have various perfectionist tendencies to a certain extent, but I recommend that you try to turn them off to a certain extent when it comes to R. In the first instance just try to write code that works, especially in the early days. You can always come back and improve aspects of it. But it is important to actually ship. 5.4 Style Comment your code. There is no one way to write code, especially in R. However there are some general guidelines that will make it easier for you even if you’re just working on your own. Comment your code. Comments in R can be added by including the # symbol. The shortcut on mac is Command + Shift + m. You don’t have to put a comment at the start of the line, it can be midway through. In general you don’t need to comment what every aspect of your code is doing but you should comment parts that are not obvious. For instnace if you read in some value then you may like to comment where it is coming from. You should also try to comment why you are doing something. Comment your code. I like to break my code into sections. For instance, setting up my workspace, reading in datasets, manipulating and cleaning the dataset, analysing the datasets, and finally producing tables and figures. While it can be difficult to speak generally, I usually separate each of those certainly with comments explaining what is going on, and sometimes into separate files, depending on the length. Comment your code. Additionally, at the top of each file I put basic information, such as the purpose of the file, and pre-requisites or dependencies, the date, the author and contact information, and finally and red-flags, bodies, or todos. Comment your code. 5.5 Learning more One of the great aspects of R is that there is a friendly community of people who use it. There are a variety of ways that I learn about new tricks, functions, and packages including: R Ladies ‘is a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community’. Whether that is your cup of tea or not, they tend to share fantastic material on their twitter feeds: https://twitter.com/rladiesglobal and https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies (where someone takes over the account for the week, so the enthusiasm never wanes). If you’re in Toronto, then the local chapter is: https://rladies.org/canada-rladies/locality/Toronto/ and https://www.meetup.com/rladies-toronto/. R Weekly is a weekly newsletter that highlights new things that have happened recently. I don’t really like any of the R podcasts, but a popular one is Not So Standard Deviations. Sharla Gelfand’s #tofunctionsmostdays: https://github.com/sharlagelfand/twofunctionsmostdays. Another great way to learn is by exchanging your code with others. Initially, just have them read it and give you feedback about it. But after you get a bit more confident run each other’s code. The most efficiently I’ve ever improved in my R journey has been by having Monica try to run my code. "],

Key concepts/skills/etc Work out an ethical framework that is appropriate to you. Apply it consistently. Update it regularly. 6.1 Introduction “We shouldn’t have to think about the societal impact of our work because it’s hard and other people can do it for us” is a really bad argument. I stopped doing CV research because I saw the impact my work was having. I loved the work but the military applications and privacy concerns eventually became impossible to ignore. But basically all facial recognition work would not get published if we took Broader Impacts sections seriously. There is almost no upside and enormous downside risk. To be fair though i should have a lot of humility here. For most of grad school I bought in to the myth that science is apolitical and research is objectively moral and good no matter what the subject is. Joe Redmon, 20 February 2020. Although the term ‘data science’ is ubiquitous in academia, industry, and even more generally, it is difficult to define. One deliberately antagonistic definition of data science is ‘[t]he inhumane reduction of humanity down to what can be counted’ (Keyes, 2019). While purposefully controversial, this definition highlights one reason for the increased demand for data science and quantitative methods over the past decade—individuals and their behaviour are now at the heart of it. Many of the techniques have been around for many decades, but what makes them popular now is this human focus. Unfortunately, even though much of the work may be focused on individuals, issues of privacy and consent, and ethical concerns more broadly, rarely seem front of mind. While there are some exceptions, in general, even at the same time as claiming that AI, machine learning, and data science are going to revolutionise society, these types of issues appear to have been largely treated as things that are nice to have, rather than issues that we may like to think of before we embrace the revolution. For the most part, these are not new issues. In the sciences, there has been considerable recent ethical consideration around CRISPR technology and gene editing, but in an earlier time similar conversations were had, for instance, about Wernher von Braun being allowed to building rockets for the US. In medicine, of course, these concerns have been front-of-mind for some time. There is some evidence that data scientists are beginning to be more concerned about the ethics surrounding the practice. For instance, NeurIPS, the most prestigious machine learning conference, now requires a statement on ethics to accompany all submissions. In order to provide a balanced perspective, authors are required to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. Authors should take care to discuss both positive and negative outcomes. NeurIPS call for papers, as accessed 26 February 2020. The purpose of this chapter is not to prescriptively rule things in or out, but to provide some aspects that you may like to think about when you go about your work. The variety of data science applications, the relative youth of the field, and the speed of change, mean that ethical considerations can sometimes be set aside when it comes to data science. This is in contrast to fields such as science, medicine, engineering, and accounting where there is a long history. Nonetheless it can helpful to think through some ethical considerations that you may encounter in the content of a usual data science project. 6.2 Question/task Think about how, even with the best of intentions, the question or task that you are wanting to do could be implemented in a way that is unethical. Here I think about the raw incentives that are being faced. This may be obvious. For instance, in the case of the Wells Fargo bank accounts situation, it should have been clear to management that having unachievable goals would result in bad decisions. But in the case of a data science project it can be more difficult to see. Think about a lending decision and the variables that go into that. If race (and what does that even mean?) is an important variable then we need to think about whether that is a model that we want to be using. (In the case of race, it’s not just an ethical question, but could be a legal one.) Similarly, what about age or sex? Is asking these questions likely to actively harm people? To what extent are we willing to trade off that harm? And are the benefits and costs accruing to different groups? It’s often some particular group that pays, while some other group benefits. 6.3 Data There is a general framework for ethical behaviour when it comes to data in the context of medicine and the sciences. This includes: Institutional review boards (IRB), which is generally designed to protect the participants in a study. These rarely exist in data science settings, but even when they do it is not clear that they are able to operate appropriately, for instance the ‘gay face’ paper was approved by IRB. Informed consent, for instance, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment is an infamous study in which patients were deliberately not informed that they had syphilis, nor were they treated, despite being part of a study about the effect of syphilis. This case prompted considerable changes in the way that medical studies were approved. While this is considerably less important, it is worth comparing this with, for instance, the deliberate collection of data by technology firms, such as Amazon and Apple to train Alexa and Siri. To what extent do the people who are part of this data collection know that their conversations is being used for this? How likely are we to similarly see government intervention? Confidentiality. There are so many flagrant examples of confidentiality being violated in data science that it would be pointless to name them here. Think about the most recent one that affected you. However, it is worth pointing out that in Canada, at least, although the laws and regulations are quite patchy, the Privacy Commissioner as well as parliament are likely to introduce changes in 2020 (Scassa, 2020, ‘Privacy reform and the federal mandate letters’, 7 February.) Try to bake in privacy and confidentiality concerns from the start, rather than just adding it on at the end. It’s not PII There’s no way it’s PII It was PII ‘A GDPR data privacy haiku’, Lisa Phillips, 13 November 2018. It’s also the case that when using machine learning, we train it on the past. To use a trivial example - if we wanted to forecast the race and sex of the next US president, it would be a brave model that didn’t suggest it would be a white person, because that is what all of them apart from one, have been; and it would be a braver model that didn’t suggest it would be a man. Does this mean the model is biased or that history is? But if we are wanting to make forecasts about the future, then what do we want? Similarly, what would be most accurate? Finally, consider the source of the dataset. There are many cases where academic work has been done using hacked data, for instance, the Ashley Madison. 6.4 Model There are basic aspects around constructing the model including ensuring that it is transparent, and reproducible. There may be other concerns, such as ensuring the model results are not a result of p-hacking. The scale of data science projects means that the potential for abuse and different outcomes at large-scale should be considered. While a data science project may be ethical at a small-scale, it may be unethical at large-scale. There may also be different ethical concerns when a project is under your control compared with if it was available to others. Finally, while it may be the case that the person who made the model understands the trade-offs and value-judgements that were part of constructing the model, it is possible that others may not. This may lead to a false confidence in the results of the model because of a false sense of the impartiality of statistics and quantitative methods more generally, and a failure to properly appreciate the assumptions. 6.5 Team People tend to hire people who are similar to them. If this happens in the context of a data science team then what are the sorts of effects that are possible on even the best-intentioned workflow? Should a team that consists only of Australians really be hired by the Maple Leafs to analyse hockey? Do the decision-makers understand the trade-offs and realities involved in data science to an extent that they can make informed decisions? Finally, consider the existence of conflicts of interest.

Do you want the AI surgeon to be illegal? Geoffrey Hinton, 20 February 2020. The number one thing to keep in mind about machine learning is that performance is evaluated on samples from one dataset, but the model is used in production on samples that may not necessarily follow the same characteristics… The finance industry has a saying for this: “past performance is no guarantee of future results”. Your model scoring X on your test dataset doesn’t mean it will perform at level X on the next N situations it encounters in the real world. The future may not be like the past. So when asking the question, “would you rather use a model that was evaluated as 90% accurate, or a human that was evaluated as 80% accurate”, the answer depends on whether your data is typical per the evaluation process. Humans are adaptable, models are not. If significant uncertainty is involved, go with the human. They may have inferior pattern recognition capabilities (versus models trained on enormous amounts of data), but they understand what they do, they can reason about it, and they can improvise when faced with novelty If every possible situation is known and you want to prioritize scalability and cost-reduction, go with the model. Models exist to encode and operationalize human cognition in well-understood situations. (“well understood” meaning either that it can be explicitly described by a programmer, or that you can amass a dataset that densely samples the distribution of possible situations – which must be static) François Chollet, 20 February 2020. If science is about systematically building and organising knowledge in terms of testable explanations and predictions, then data science takes this and focuses on data. Fundamentally data science is still science, and as such, building and organising knowledge is a critical aspect. Being able to do something yourself, once, does not achieve this. Hence, the focus on reproducibility and replicability. From the readings (Alexander), ‘Research is reproducible if it can be reproduced exactly, given all the materials used in the study.’ ‘[Hence] materials need to be provided!’. ’‘[M]aterials’ usually means data, code and software.’ The minimum requirement is to be able to ‘[r]eproduce the data, methods and results (including figures, tables)’. Also from the readings (Gelman), you should have noticed that this has been an issue in other sciences. e.g. psychology. The issue with not being reproducible is that we are not contributing to knowledge. We no longer have any idea was is fact in the field of psychology. (This is coming for other fields too, including the field that I was trained in - economics.) Do this matter? Yes. Some of the examples that Gelman cites (which turned out to be dodgy) don’t really matter e.g. ESP or the power pose. It doesn’t really matter. But increasingly the same methods are being applied in areas where they do matter e.g. ‘nudge’ units. Similarly, from the readings (Simpson), we can see that it’s a big problem in data science. The ‘gay face’ paper that Simpson writes about has not released their dataset. We have no way of knowing what is going on with it. They have found a certain set of results based on that dataset, their methods, and what they did, but we have no way of knowing how much that matters. As Simpson says ‘the paper itself does some things right. It has a detailed discussion of the limitations of the data and the method’. You must do this in everything that you write, but it is not enough. Without the data, we don’t know what their results speak to as we don’t understand how representative the sample is. If the dataset is biased, then that undermines their claims. There’s a reason that while initial medical trials are done on mice, etc, eventually human trials are required. In order to do the study they needed a trained dataset. They trained it using Mechanical Turk. From Mattson (Figure 9.1. Figure 9.1: Instructions for workers to do classification piecework on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform, p. 46. From Mattson. From Mattson: The problems here are legion: Barack Obama is biracial but simply “Black” by American cultural norms. “Clearly Latino” begs the question “to whom?” Latino is an ethnic category, not a racial one: many Latinos already are Caucasian, and increasingly so. By training their workers according to stereotypical American categories, WAK’s algorithm can only spit out the garbage they put in. ‘WAK’s algorithm can only spit out the garbage they put in.’ I would encourage you to print out that statement and paste it somewhere that you will see it every time you get a data science result. What steps can we take to make our work reproducible? Ensure your entire workflow is documented. How did you get the raw data? Can you save the raw data? Will the raw data always be available? Is the raw data available to others? What steps are you taking to transform the raw data in data that can be analysed? How are you analysing the data? How are you building the report? Try to improve each time. Can you run you entire workflow again? Can ‘another person’ run your entire workflow again? Can a future you run your entire workflow again? Can a future ‘another person’ run your entire workflow again? Each of these requirements is increasingly more onerous. We are going to start with worrying about the first. The way we are going to do this is by using R Markdown. 9.2 Data access From the readings: Considering that any scientific study should be based on raw data, and that data storage space should no longer be a challenge, journals, in principle, should try to have their authors publicize raw data in a public database or journal site upon the publication of the paper to increase reproducibility of the published results and to increase public trust in science. Tsuyoshi Miyakawa 9.3 On mistakes Everyone makes mistakes. Own them, loudly. Fix them, quickly. Regardless of what you think about Nate Silver, but that article in the recommended readings is impressive. "],

This means that all of the aspects are consistent, for instance, all ‘main headings’ will look the same. However it means that use symbols to designate how you would like certain aspects to appear, and it is only when you compile it that you get to see it. R Markdown is a variant of regular markdown that is specifically designed to allow R code chunks to be included. The advantage is that you can get a ‘live’ document in which code executes and is then printed to a document. The disadvantage is that it can take a while for the document to compile because all of the code needs to run. You can create a new R Markdown document within R Studio (File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown Document). Another advantage of R Markdown is that very similar code can compile into a variety of documents, including html pages and PDFs. R Markdown also has default options set up for including a title, author, and date sections. 10.1.2 Basic commands If you ever need a reminder of the basics of R Markdown then this is built into R Studio (Help -&gt; Markdown Quick Reference). This provides the code for commonly needed commands: Emphasis: *italic*, **bold**, _italic_, __bold__ Headers (these need to go on their own line with a line before and after): # Header 1, ## Header 2, ### Header 3 Lists: Unordered List * Item 1 * Item 2 + Item 2a + Item 2b Ordered List 1. Item 1 2. Item 2 3. Item 3 + Item 3a + Item 3b URLs: Can just include an address: http://example.com, or can include a [linked phrase](http://example.com). Basic images can just be included either from the internet: ![alt text](http://example.com/logo.png) or from a local file: ![alt text](figures/img.png). In order to create an actual document, once you have these pieces set up, click ‘Knit’. 10.1.3 R chunks You can include R (and a bunch of other languages) code in code chunks within your R Markdown document. Then when you knit your document, the R code will run and be included in your document. To create an R chunk start with three backticks and then within curly braces tell markdown that this is an R chunk. Anything inside this chunk will be considered R code and run as such. library(tidyverse) ggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_point(aes(x = price, y = carat)) There are various evaluation options that are available in chunks. You include these by putting a comma after r and then specifying any options before the closing curly brace. Helpful options include: echo = FALSE: run the code and include the output, but don’t print the code in the document. include = FALSE: run the code but don’t output anything and don’t print the code in the document. eval = FALSE: don’t run the code, and hence don’t include the outpus, but do print the code in the document. 10.1.4 Abstracts and PDF outputs In the default header, you can add a section for a header, so that it would look like this: --- title: My document author: Rohan Alexander date: 25 February 2020 output: html_document abstract: &quot;This is my abstract.&quot; --- Similarly, you can change the output from html_document to pdf_document in order to produce a PDF. This uses LaTeX in the background so you may need to install a bunch of related packages. 10.2 R projects RStudio has the option of creating a project, which allows you to keep all the files (data, analysis, report etc) associated with a particular project together. To create a project, click Click File &gt; New Project, then select empty project, name your project and think about where you want to save it. For example, if you are creating a project for Problem Set 2, you might call it ps2 and save it in a sub-folder called PS2 in your INF2178 folder. Once you have created a project, a new file with the extension .RProj will appear in that file. As an example, download the R help folder. Whenever I work on class materials, I open the project file and work from that. The main advantage of projects is that you don’t have to set the working directory or type the whole file path to read in a file (for example, a data file). So instead of reading a csv from &quot;~/Documents/toronto/teaching/INF2178/data/&quot; you can just read it in from data/. "],

Key concepts/skills/etc The importance of version control in a modern scientific workflow. The basics of Git and GitHub, as a solo data scientist. Key GitHub workflow with commands Get the latest changes: git pull. Add your updates: git add -A. Check on everything: git status. Commit your changes: git commit -m &quot;Short description of changes&quot;. Push your changes to GitHub: git push. 11.1 Introduction In this lab we introduce Git and GitHub. These are tools that: enhance the reproducibility of your work by making it easier to share your code and data; make it easier to show off your work; improve your workflow by encouraging you to think systematically about your approach; and (although we won’t take advantage of this) make it easier to work in teams. Git is a version control system. One way you might be used to doing version control is to have various versions of your files: first_go.R, first_go-fixed.R, first_go-fixed-with-mons-edits.R. But this soon becomes cumbersome. Some of you may use dates, for instance: 2020-03-12-analysis.R, 2020-03-13-analysis.R, 2020-03-14-analysis.R, etc. While this keeps a record it can be difficult to search if you need to go back - will you really remember the date of some change in a week? How about a month or a year? It gets unwieldy fairly quickly. Instead of this, Git allows you to only have one version of the file analysis.R and it keeps a record of the changes to that file, and a snapshot of that file at a given point in time. When it takes that snapshot is determined by you. When you want Git to take a snapshot you additionally include a message, saying what changed between this snapshot and the last. In that way, there is only ever one version of the file, but the history can be more easily searched. The issue is that Git was designed for software developers. As such, while it works, it can be a little ungainly for non-developers (Figure 11.1). Figure 11.1: An infamous response to the launch of Dropbox in 2007, trivialising the use-case for Dropbox. Hence, GitHub, GitLab, and various other companies offer easier-to-use services that build on Git. GitHub used to be the weapon of choice, but they were sold to Microsoft in 2018 and since then other variants such as GitLab have risen in popularity. We will introduce GitHub here because it remains the most popular, and it is built into RStudio, however you should feel free to explore other options. One of the hardest aspects of Git, and the rest, for me was the terminology. Folders are called repos. Saving is called a commit. These are brief notes and you should refer to Jenny Bryan’s book for further detail. Frankly, I can’t improve on Bryan’s book and I use them regularly myself. 11.2 Git Check if you have Git installed by opening R Studio and then going to the Terminal and typing the following and then return. git --version If you get a version number, then you are done (Figure 11.2). Figure 11.2: How to access the Terminal within R Studio If you have a Mac then Git should come pre-installed, if you have Windows then there’s a chance, and if you have Linux then you probably don’t need this guide. If you don’t get a version number, then you need to install it. Please go to Jenny Bryan’s book for some instructions based on your operating system: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html/. After you have Git, then you need to tell it your username and email. You need this because Git adds this information whenever you take a ‘snapshot’, or to use Git’s language whenever you make a commit. Again, within the Terminal, type the following, replacing the details with yours, and then return after each line. git config --global user.name &#39;Jane Doe&#39; git config --global user.email &#39;jane@example.com&#39; git config --global --list The details that you enter here will be public (there are various ways to hide your email address if you need to do this and GitHub provides instructions about this). Again, if you have issues or need more detailed instructions please go to the relevant section of Jenny Bryan’s book: https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html. 11.3 GitHub The first step is to create an account on GitHub (https://github.com) (Figure 11.3). Figure 11.3: Sign up screen at GitHub GitHub doesn’t have the most intuitive user experience in the world, but we are now going to make a new folder (which is called a ‘repo’ in Git). You are looking for a plus sign in the top right, and then select ‘New Repository’ (Figure 11.4). Figure 11.4: Create a new repository At this point you can add a sensible name for your repo. Leave it as public (you can delete it later if you want). And check the box to initialize with a readme. In the ‘Add .gitignore’ option you can leave it for now, but if you start using GitHub more regularly then you may like to select the R option here. (That just tells Git to ignore various files.) After that, just click the button to create a new repository (Figure 11.5). Figure 11.5: Create a new repository, really You’ll now be taken to a screen that is fairly empty, but the details that you need are in the green ‘Clone or Download’ button, then click the clipboard (Figure 11.6). Figure 11.6: Get the details of your new repository Now you need to open Terminal, and use cd to get to where you want to save the folder, then: git clone https://github.com/RohanAlexander/test.git At this point, a new folder has been created. We can now interact with it. The first step is almost always to pull the latest changes with git pull (this is slightly pointless in this example because it’s just us but it’s a good habit to get into). We can then make a change to the folder, for instance, update the readme, and then save it as usual. Once this is done, we need to add, commit, and push. As before, use cd to navigate to your folder, then git status to see if there is anything going on (you should see some reference to the change you made). Then git add -A adds the changes to the staging area (this seems pointless, and it is in this context, but this allows you to specify specific files and similar if needed). Then git status to check what has happened. Then git commit -m &quot;Minor update to readme&quot;, and then git status to check on everything, and finally git push. To summarise (assuming you are in the relevant folder): git pull git status git add -A git status git commit -m &quot;Short commit message&quot; git status git push 11.4 Using Git within RStudio I promised that GitHub was built into RStudio, but so far we’ve not really taken advantage of that. The way to do it is to create a new repo in GitHub, and copy the information. At this point, you open RStudio, select Files, New Project, Version Control, Git, and you paste the information for the repo. Go through the rest of it, saving the folder somewhere sensible, and clicking ‘Open in new session’. This will then create a new folder on your computer which will be a Git folder that is linked to the GitHub repo that you created. There are more details on Jenny Bryan’s book: https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html. 11.5 Next steps We haven’t really taken advantage of GitHub’s features in terms of teams or branches. That is certainly something that you should get into once you have more confidence with these basics. As always, when it comes to Git for data scientists who use R, you should go to the relevant sections of Jenny Bryan’s book. "],

We do this with library(): library(opendatatoronto) library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(ggplot2) 12.2 Finding and downloading data using opendatatoronto 12.2.1 Finding the data To find a dataset you like, you have a couple options: Search for a dataset manually via the Toronto Open Data Portal Use the search_packages() function Here we’ll use the search_packages() function to keep this document self-contained. # Search packages (this returns a table) delay_packages &lt;- search_packages(&quot;delay&quot;) # Print the table delay_packages ## # A tibble: 3 x 10 ## title id topics civic_issues excerpt dataset_category num_resources formats ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 TTC … 996c… Trans… Mobility TTC Su… Document 35 XLSX ## 2 TTC … b68c… Trans… Mobility TTC St… Document 7 XLSX ## 3 TTC … e271… Trans… Mobility TTC Bu… Document 7 XLSX ## # … with 2 more variables: refresh_rate &lt;chr&gt;, last_refreshed &lt;date&gt; The R output might not show the full titles of the datasets when it prints the dataframe.

I do this using list_package_resources(). The argument of this function is a 1-line dataframe in the format of the output of search_packages(). So before I use list_package_resources(), I narrow down the ridership_packages dataframe like so using the filter() function: subway_delay_package&lt;- delay_packages %&gt;% filter(title == &quot;TTC Subway Delay Data&quot;) # Only keep the row(s) where the title is &quot;TTC Subway Delay Data&quot; Our new 1-line data frame looks like: subway_delay_package ## # A tibble: 1 x 10 ## title id topics civic_issues excerpt dataset_category num_resources formats ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 TTC … 996c… Trans… Mobility TTC Su… Document 35 XLSX ## # … with 2 more variables: refresh_rate &lt;chr&gt;, last_refreshed &lt;date&gt; Now we can pass this as an argument to list_package_resources(): list_package_resources(subway_delay_package) ## # A tibble: 35 x 4 ## name id format last_modified ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; ## 1 ttc-subway-delay-codes fece136b-224a-412a-b191-8d… XLSX 2019-08-15 ## 2 ttc-subway-delay-jan-2014-a… 6664420f-316f-4f94-9ba4-d4… XLSX 2019-08-15 ## 3 ttc-subway-delay-may-2017 d1159888-0035-45a0-b238-86… XLSX 2019-08-15 ## 4 ttc-subway-delay-june-2017 240d8e8c-d300-4f91-b94f-cb… XLSX 2019-08-15 ## 5 ttc-subway-delay-july-2017 98d4ac77-aa9f-40a3-97ee-6f… XLSX 2019-08-15 ## 6 ttc-subway-delay-august-2017 92e7649a-cf2f-4ac7-9802-b7… XLSX 2019-08-15 ## 7 ttc-subway-delay-september-… 61412f10-656b-4992-9a1a-a1… XLSX 2019-08-15 ## 8 ttc-subway-delay-october-20… 69a6db37-7982-49c7-8dbc-56… XLSX 2019-08-15 ## 9 ttc-subway-delay-november-2… 10080217-8022-41c0-a8ba-2a… XLSX 2019-08-15 ## 10 ttc-subway-delay-december-2… a731c4bb-630a-4530-b590-b3… XLSX 2019-08-15 ## # … with 25 more rows Again, we might have trouble seeing the full first column, so let’s extract the name column as a vector: list_package_resources(subway_delay_package)$name ## [1] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-codes&quot; ## [2] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-jan-2014-april-2017&quot; ## [3] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-may-2017&quot; ## [4] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-june-2017&quot; ## [5] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-july-2017&quot; ## [6] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-august-2017&quot; ## [7] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-september-2017&quot; ## [8] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-october-2017&quot; ## [9] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-november-2017&quot; ## [10] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-december-2017&quot; ## [11] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-january-2018&quot; ## [12] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-february-2018&quot; ## [13] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-march-2018&quot; ## [14] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-april-2018&quot; ## [15] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-may-2018&quot; ## [16] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-june-2018&quot; ## [17] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-july-2018&quot; ## [18] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-august-2018&quot; ## [19] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-september-2018&quot; ## [20] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-october-2018&quot; ## [21] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-november-2018&quot; ## [22] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-december-2018&quot; ## [23] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-readme&quot; ## [24] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-january-2019&quot; ## [25] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-february-2019&quot; ## [26] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-march-2019&quot; ## [27] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-april-2019&quot; ## [28] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-may-2019&quot; ## [29] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-june-2019&quot; ## [30] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-July 2019&quot; ## [31] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-August-2019&quot; ## [32] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-September 2019&quot; ## [33] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-October-2019\\t&quot; ## [34] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-November-2019&quot; ## [35] &quot;ttc-subway-delay-December-2019&quot; 12.2.2 Retrieving the data Suppose we’re interested in looking at the delay in September of 2018.

In the dataframe, each row represents one delay, and the affected subway line is recorded in the Line column: # See what the &quot;Line&quot; column looks like subway_sept2018 %&gt;% select(Line) ## # A tibble: 1,794 x 1 ## Line ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 BD ## 2 BD ## 3 YU ## 4 BD ## 5 YU ## 6 YU ## 7 YU ## 8 YU ## 9 YU ## 10 YU ## # … with 1,784 more rows Before the data is ready to plot, we want to count the number of observations for each subway line. We can do this with the summarise() function from dplyr: line_counts &lt;- subway_sept2018 %&gt;% group_by(Line) %&gt;% # This tells the following commands to perform operations &quot;grouping&quot; by Line summarise(number_of_delays = n()) # Count the number of observations using n() # Print line_counts ## # A tibble: 5 x 2 ## Line number_of_delays ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 BD 773 ## 2 SHP 45 ## 3 SRT 63 ## 4 YU 881 ## 5 YU/BD 32 Here’s an example of making a bar chart using ggplot: # Pass data to ggplot: # (Also specify our x and y axes): ggplot(line_counts, aes(x = Line, y = number_of_delays)) + # Specify that we want a bar graph: geom_col() + # Add titles and axis labels: labs(title = &quot;TTC Subway Delays in Sept. 2018&quot;, x = &quot;Subway Line&quot;, y = &quot;Number of Delays&quot;) 12.3.2 Example 2: Delays by time of day Here I’m interested in the Time column which records the time of day of the delay.

Notice that we’re only interested in keeping the hour part (i.e. the 2 numbers before the :). We can do this using the separate() function from the tidyr package. hour_counts &lt;- subway_sept2018 %&gt;% # Separate Time into hour and minute separate(Time, into = c(&quot;hour&quot;, &quot;minute&quot;), sep = &quot;:&quot;) %&gt;% # Group by hour so that our counting function will count by groups group_by(hour) %&gt;% # Count summarise(number_of_delays = n()) # Print hour_counts ## # A tibble: 24 x 2 ## hour number_of_delays ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 00 53 ## 2 01 54 ## 3 02 20 ## 4 03 10 ## 5 04 56 ## 6 05 60 ## 7 06 73 ## 8 07 90 ## 9 08 131 ## 10 09 84 ## # … with 14 more rows Then we can plot using similar syntax to the previous example. This time we’ll use a line graph, which we specify using geom_line(). ggplot(hour_counts, aes(x = hour, y = number_of_delays)) + geom_line(aes(group = 1)) + # group=1 tells the line graph that all points are connected labs(title = &quot;TTC Subway Delays by the hour, Sept. 2018&quot;, x = &quot;Hour of day&quot;, y = &quot;Number of delays&quot;) "],

(This paper was written a while ago for economists, please just ignore the economics specific parts.) Key concepts/skills/etc Data-first research. Question-first research. Developing important questions. Pre-quiz What are three features of a good research question? What is a counterfactual? 13.1 Developing research questions Both qualitative and quantitative approaches have their place, but here we focus on quantitative approaches. (Qualitative research is important as well, and often the most interesting work has a little of both - ‘mixed methods’.) This means that we are subject to issues surrounding data quality, scales, measures, sources, etc. We are especially interested in trying to tease out causality. Broadly there are two ways to go about research: 1) data-first, 2) question-first. If you get a job somewhere typically you will initially be data-first. This means that you will need to work out the questions that you can reasonably answer with the data available to you. After you show some promise, you may be given the latitude to explore specific questions, possibly even gathering data specifically for that purpose. Contrast this with the example of the Behavioural Insights Team, (IEP, p.23) who got to design and then carry out experiments given the remit of the entire British government (as they were spun out of the prime minister’s office). When deciding the questions that you can reasonably answer with the data that are available, you need to think about: Theory: Do you have a reasonable expectation that there is something causal that could be determined? Charting the stock market - maybe, but might be better with haruspex because at least that way you have something you could eat. You need a reasonable theory of how \\(x\\) may be affecting \\(y\\). Importance: There are plenty of trivial questions that you could ask, but it’s important to not waste you time. The importance of a question also helps with motivation when you are on your fourth straight week of cleaning data and de-bugging your code. It also (and this becomes important) makes it easier to get talented people to work with you, or similarly to convince people to fund you or allow you to work on this project. Availability: Can you reasonably expect get more data about this research question in the future or is this the extent of the data that could be gathered? Iteration: Is this something that you can come back to and run often or is this a once-off analysis? Aaron Miller points to the ‘FINER framework’ as a mnemonic device used in medicine. This framework reminds us to ask questions that are (quoting from Hulley S, Cummings S, Browner W, et al. Designing clinical research. 3rd ed. Philadelphia (PA): Lippincott Williams and Wilkins; 2007): Feasible: Adequate number of subjects; adequate technical expertise; affordable in time and money; manageable in scope. Interesting: Getting the answer intrigues investigator, peers and community. Novel: Confirms, refutes or extends previous findings Ethical: Amenable to a study that institutional review board will approve. Relevant: To scientific knowledge; to clinical and health policy; to future research. Farrugia P, Petrisor BA, Farrokhyar F, Bhandari M. (2010) build on this in terms of developing research questions and recommend PICOT (quoting from Farrugia, et al.): Population: What specific population are you interested in? Intervention: What is your investigational intervention? Comparison group: What is the main alternative to compare with the intervention? Outcome of interest: What do you intend to accomplish, measure, improve or affect? Time: What is the appropriate follow-up time to assess outcome I want to follow up on a couple of aspects here: Time: Often this will be constrained, possibly in interesting ways. If we are interested in the the effect of Trump’s tweets on the stock market, then that can be done just by looking at the minutes (milliseconds?) after he tweets. But what if we are interested in the effect of a cancer drug on long term outcomes? If the effect takes 20 years then we either have to wait a while, or we need to look at people who were treated in 2000, but then we have selection effects and different circumstances to if we give the drug today. Often the only reasonable thing to do is to build a statistical model, but then we need adequate sample sizes, etc. Comparison: The creation of a counterfactual is crucial. A counterfactual is an in-then statement in which the if is false. Consider the example of Humpty Dumpty from Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass: Figure 13.1: Humpty Dumpty example Humpty is satisfied with what would happened if he were to fall off, even though he is similarly satisfied that this would never happen. (I won’t ruin the story for you.) The comparison group often determines your results e.g. the relationship between VO2 and athletic outcomes, cf elite athletic outcomes. Ethics: Often these guides are focused on ethics boards etc. But we often don’t have those in data science applications. Even if your intentions are unimpeachable I want to suggest one additional aspect to think about, and that is Bayes theorem: \\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)\\times P(A)}{P(B)}\\] The probability of A given B depends on the probability of B given A, the probabilty of A, and the probability of B. To see why, let’s go to the canonical Bayes example: There is some test for a disease that is 99 per cent accurate both ways (that is, if a person actually has the disease there is a 99 per cent chance the test says positive, and is a person does not have the disease then there is a 99 per cent chance the test says negative). Let’s just say that only 0.5 of the population has the disease. Then if we randomly pick someone from the general population then the chance that they have the disease is outstandingly low. EVEN IF THEY TEST POSITIVE!: \\[\\frac{0.99\\times0.005}{0.99\\times0.005 + 0.01\\times0.995} \\approx 33.2\\] To see this in action, consider the example of Google’s cancer testing: https://blog.google/technology/health/improving-breast-cancer-screening/. And then consider the points raised by Vinay Prasad: https://twitter.com/VPrasadMDMPH/status/1212840987363442689. "],

Pre-quiz Please identify three sources of government data in your country and describe where are they available (please include a link if possible)? Please focus on one of those sources. What steps do you have to go through in order to get a dataset such that it can be analysed in R? Please identify three sources of private data that you are interested in and describe where are they available (please include a link if possible)? Please focus on one of those sources. What steps do you have to go through in order to get a dataset that can be analysed in R? What are some types of probability sampling? Let’s say you take a job at RBC (a Canadian bank) and they already have some quantitative data for you to use. What are some questions that you should explore when deciding whether that data will be useful to you? There have been some substantial political polling ‘misses’ in recent years (Trump and Brexit come to mind). To what extent do you think non-response bias was the cause of this? 14.1 Gathering data 14.1.1 Deliberately available There are a variety of different options in terms of gathering data. We may find government datasets (opendatatoronto), censuses (distinguished given their importance), private sector datesets (Airbnb). These are datasets that have been made available deliberately for these purposes. It may be that a survey has been run in order to generate this data. If that’s the case then we need to be aware of: What is the relevant population? How was the sampling frame identified? What method of sampling are they using? If probabilistic then is it: Random sampling? (Everyone the same chance.) Stratified random sampling? (Everyone has the same chance within certain groups.) Cluster sampling? (Everyone has the same chance within a given cluster, and no chance outside that cluster.) If non-probabilistic, then what types of errors can occur and is there anything that you can do about it? When we are thinking about these aspects, we need to think about how they could affect our results and if there is any way of adjusting for it. Either way, these aspects always need to be mentioned. 14.1.2 By product There are also datasets that can be created as a by-product of someone trying to achieve another aim. For instance, a retailer may have a website with their products and their prices. That has not been created deliberately as a source of data, but we can scrape it to create a dataset. There are a few general principles that I try to follow when it comes to this: Try to use an API. Check robots.txt. Slow down (why not only have it run once a minute if it can just run in the background?). Considering the timing (if it’s a retailer then why not set your script to run overnight). Only scrape once (save the data as you go and monitor where you are up to). Don’t republish the data you scraped (cf datasets that create based off it). Take ownership (add contact details to your scripts, don’t hide behind VPNs, etc) "],

Unfortunately it’s priced accordingly so actual Paspaley purchases may be more rare than you may like. It might be interesting to respectfully scrape their website and see if we can have a look at their offerings. 16.2 Data acquisition Looking at the website: https://www.paspaley.com/, Paspaley organises the products by category (e.g. bracelet, earrings, etc). Figure 16.1: Screnshot of the categories page. It also categorises them by collection (e.g. Monsoon, Rockpool, etc). Figure 16.2: Screnshot of the collections page. Save each of those summary pages and we can then scrape the links for each of the individual products from them using rvest. library(purrr) library(rvest) library(tidyverse) # We&#39;re doing it properly and writing a function. We&#39;ll pass that function, and a list of files on which to apply it, to purrr. get_links &lt;- function(file_to_look_at){ content &lt;- read_html(file_to_look_at) %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;.product-item-info&quot;) %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;.product&quot;) %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;a&quot;) link &lt;- content %&gt;% html_attr(&quot;href&quot;) text &lt;- content %&gt;% html_text(trim = TRUE) collection &lt;- str_replace(file_to_look_at, &quot;inputs/paspaley/lists_by_collection/&quot;, &quot;&quot;) %&gt;% str_replace(&quot;.htm&quot;, &quot;&quot;) return(tibble(link = link, text = text, collection = collection)) } the_files &lt;- c( &quot;inputs/paspaley/lists/lists_by_collection/kimberley.htm&quot;, &quot;inputs/paspaley/lists/lists_by_collection/lavalier.htm&quot;, &quot;inputs/paspaley/lists/lists_by_collection/maxima.htm&quot;, &quot;inputs/paspaley/lists/lists_by_collection/monsoon.htm&quot;, &quot;inputs/paspaley/lists/lists_by_collection/rockpool.htm&quot;, &quot;inputs/paspaley/lists/lists_by_collection/strand.htm&quot;, &quot;inputs/paspaley/lists/lists_by_collection/touchstone.htm&quot; ) the_data &lt;- purrr::map_df(the_files, get_links) the_data &lt;- the_data %&gt;% mutate(product = str_replace_all(link, c(&quot;https://www.paspaley.com/pearl-collections/the-kimberley-bracelet/&quot; = &quot;&quot;, &quot;https://www.paspaley.com/pearl-collections/lavalier/&quot; = &quot;&quot;, &quot;https://www.paspaley.com/pearl-collections/maxima/&quot; = &quot;&quot;, &quot;https://www.paspaley.com/pearl-collections/monsoon/&quot; = &quot;&quot;, &quot;https://www.paspaley.com/pearl-collections/rockpool/&quot; = &quot;&quot;, &quot;https://www.paspaley.com/pearl-collections/strands/&quot; = &quot;&quot;, &quot;https://www.paspaley.com/pearl-collections/touchstone/&quot; = &quot;&quot;)), year = 2019) write_csv(the_data, &quot;outputs/misc/2019_links_from_collections.csv&quot;) You can use a similar script to get the categories. Comparing the two indicates that the XML had a handful of products that were not part of a collection or a category, but not vice versa, so no worries. Now that we have the list of the products that we’d like details about, we need to download the page for each product. library(rvest) library(tidyverse) the_data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;outputs/2019_links_from_categories.csv&quot;) for (i in 1:length(the_data$link)) { product_data &lt;- read_html(the_data$link[i]) product_name &lt;- str_replace_all(the_data$link[i], &quot;https://www.paspaley.com/jewellery/&quot;, &quot;&quot;) product_name &lt;- str_replace_all(product_name, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;-&quot;) name_of_file &lt;- paste0(&quot;inputs/2019/products/&quot;, product_name, &quot;.html&quot;) write_html(product_data, file = name_of_file) print(paste( &quot;Done with file number&quot;, i, &quot;of&quot;, length(the_data$link), &quot;at&quot;, Sys.time() )) # Helpful updating for when running it on all the records Sys.sleep(60) # Space requests by 60 seconds. } # Clean up rm(i, name_of_file, product_data, product_name) I’ve spaced out the requests by 60 seconds here. Again this is just about trying to not affect the performance of their site for other visitors. I’m not in a hurry for this project, so I just slow down the requests a fair bit. In this case there were only a few hundred pages, so it was just a matter of setting the computer to run while I was busy with lunch. Not a big deal. Also, I haven’t accounted for page errors, which would pause the script, like I would with a full-scale project. The way to do that is to change the scraper to a function and then to use safely on it. Now that we have saved the pages for each product and we don’t need to bother their website anymore we can get to organising the content into a dataset. 16.3 Data cleaning In the last section we downloaded the pages for each of the Paspaley products that we could find on the website. The first step to being able to analyse the data is to transform it in a format that we’re more used to, such as a table. So the task is to go through the html for each product and find the information that we are interested in: Name; Price; SKU; and Description. We’re going to be using the description to get some additional information that isn’t nicely laid out, such as the type of gold. The SKU is a unique identifier that will let us link products between years. library(purrr) # Makes it easier to do the same thing to many files library(rvest) # Goes trhough the html tags and finds what we are looking for library(tidyverse) get_product_data &lt;- function(file_to_look_at){ # file_to_look_at &lt;- c(&quot;inputs/2018/products/pearl-earrings-diamond-touchstone-earrings-12mm-oval-yellow-gold.html&quot;) # When I&#39;m writing and testing a function I tend to insert one of the files manually here. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s better ways to do this but this seems to work. (I normally delete it before showing anyone!) content &lt;- read_html(file_to_look_at) %&gt;% # read_html is an equivalent to, say, read_csv but for html files. html_nodes(&quot;.product-info-main&quot;) # Here we specify which set of nodes we are interested in. These are the ones that have to do with the products. You need to have a look at the html to work this out and it tends to be a bit of trial an error. name &lt;- content %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;.base&quot;) %&gt;% # Focus on the node that has the name html_text(trim = TRUE) # This gets the text from that node - depending on what type of information you&#39;re interested in, it might not be needed. description &lt;- content %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;.short-description&quot;) %&gt;% html_text(trim = TRUE) description &lt;- ifelse(is_empty(description), &quot;none&quot;, description) # Just in case they don&#39;t have a description we don&#39;t want an error. flowerydescription &lt;- content %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;.description&quot;) %&gt;% html_text(trim = TRUE) # Some of the products have extra descriptions. flowerydescription &lt;- ifelse(is_empty(flowerydescription), &quot;none&quot;, flowerydescription) availability &lt;- content %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;.stock&quot;) %&gt;% html_text(trim = TRUE) sku &lt;- content %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;.sku&quot;) %&gt;% html_text(trim = TRUE) price &lt;- content %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;.price&quot;) %&gt;% html_text(trim = TRUE) return(tibble( name = name, description = description, flowerydescription = flowerydescription, availability = availability, sku = sku, price = price )) # Here we gather everything into a table. Purrr will automatically combine the tables for each of the products. } products &lt;- list.files(&quot;inputs/2019/products&quot;, full.names = TRUE) # Return a list of the the files. Handy when there are many files, otherwise just a manual list works too. You can also specify the file type or that they start/end with certain words etc. Very handy. names(products) &lt;- list.files(&quot;inputs/2019/products&quot;) %&gt;% gsub(pattern = &quot;.html$&quot;, replacement = &quot;&quot;) # This just allows us to include the names of the files in the eventual full table. You can make this better so that it doesn&#39;t list the files again (dangerous in case the order changes between listings), but for this project it&#39;s fine. dataset &lt;- purrr::map_df(products, # List of files get_product_data, # Function to apply to each file .id = &quot;product&quot; # Name of the column with the filenames (otherwise the content is just 1, 2, 3,...) ) # write_csv(dataset, &quot;outputs/2019_dataset.csv&quot;) We now have the data into a table that we can work with. Unlike the usual teaching datasets, we need to clean the data so that we can apply our usual methods to them. For instance, many of the prices aren’t an integer because they have AUD in front of them and some of the SKUs have SKU in front, but not all. (I’ve not really gone into detail about the 2017 data, and it sort of just apepars here now, but it was a similar process of getting it to here.) library(stringr) # Used to make regular expressions less confronting library(tidyverse) # Read in the datasets the_2018_data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;outputs/data/2018_dataset.csv&quot;) the_2017_data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;outputs/data/2017_dataset.csv&quot;) # Combine the datasets the_2018_data$year = 2018 the_2017_data$year = 2017 the_data &lt;- rbind(the_2017_data, the_2018_data) rm(the_2017_data, the_2018_data) # Fix price the_data$price &lt;- ?str_replace_all(the_data$price, &quot;[\\r\\n]&quot; , &quot;&quot;) %&gt;% str_replace(&quot;.*\\\\$&quot;, &quot;&quot;) # Get rid of the &quot;Starting from...&quot; ones - we just want a number - this is an issue with some of the 2017 ones the_data$price &lt;- str_replace_all(the_data$price, c(&quot;AUD &quot; = &quot;&quot;, &quot;,&quot; = &quot;&quot;)) %&gt;% as.integer() # Convert to a integer - the 2018 ones start with AUD so remove that first # Fix SKU the_data$sku &lt;- str_replace_all(the_data$sku, c(&quot;SKU &quot; = &quot;&quot;)) # The 2018 ones actually start with &quot;SKU&quot; but we just want the number We’d like to be able to group the analysis by the type of item it is (necklace, earrings, etc) and by the collection (Rockpool). We can use our earlier checks to be able to get the category that Paspaley has put each item into.

Cleaning that data. Key libraries rvest tidyverse Key functions augment() glance() lm() tidy() 17.1 Introduction In this case study we are going to scrape a list of books that I own, then clean it, and look at the distribution of the first letters of author surnames. 17.2 Gather data The key library that we will use is the rvest library. This makes it easier to download a website, and to then navigate the html to find the aspects that we are interested in. You should create a new project in a new folder. Within that new folder you should make three new folders: inputs, outputs, and scripts. In the scripts folder you should write and save a script along these lines. #### Contact details #### # Title: Get data from rohanalexander.com # Purpose: This script gets data from Rohan&#39;s website about the books that he owns.

I always try to get the data into a tibble as early as possible. While it’s possible to work with the nested data, I recommend moving to a tibble so that the usual functions can be used.

Key concepts/skills/etc Quickly coming to terms with a new dataset Key libraries/functions/etc tidyverse ggplot2 Pre-quiz In your own words what is exploratory data analysis? If you have a dataset called ‘my_data’, which has two columns: ‘first_col’ and ‘second_col’, then could you please write some rough R code that would generate a graph (the type of graph doesn’t matter). Consider a dataset that has 500 rows and 3 columns, so there are 1,500 cells. If 100 of the cells are missing data for at least one of the columns, then would you remove the whole row your dataset or try to run your analysis on the data as is, or some other procedure? What if your dataset had 10,000 rows instead, but the same number of missing cells? Please note three ways of identifying unusual values. What is the difference between a categorical and continuous variable? 19.1 Introduction Exploratory data analysis is never finished, you just die. This chapter is about exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization steps in R. The aim is to get you used to working with real data (that has issues) to understand the main characteristics and potential issues. We will be using the opendatatoronto R package, which interfaces with the City of Toronto Open Data Portal. 19.2 A note on packages If you are running this Rmd on your local machine, you may need to install various packages used (using the install.packages function).

There’s no one way of exploration, but it’s important to always keep in mind: what should your variables look like (type, values, distribution, etc) what would be surprising (outliers etc) what is your end goal (here, it might be understanding factors associated with delays, e.g. stations, time of year, time of day, etc) In any data analysis project, if it turns out you have data issues, surprising values, missing data etc, it’s important you document anything you found and the subsequent steps or assumptions you made before moving onto your data analysis / modeling. As always: Start with an end in mind. Be as lazy as possible. 19.5 Data checks 19.5.1 Sanity Checks We need to check variables should be what they say they are. If they aren’t, the natural next question is to what to do with issues (recode? remove?) E.g. check days of week unique(delay_2019$day) ## [1] &quot;Tuesday&quot; &quot;Wednesday&quot; &quot;Thursday&quot; &quot;Friday&quot; &quot;Saturday&quot; &quot;Sunday&quot; ## [7] &quot;Monday&quot; Check lines: oh no. some issues here.

Our initial EDA hinted at an outlying delay time, let’s take a look at the largest delays below. Join the delay_codes dataset to see what the delay is.

I switched to density above to look at the the distributions more comparably, but we should also be aware of differences in frequency, in particular, SHP and SRT have much smaller counts: ggplot(data = delay_2019) + geom_histogram(aes(x = min_delay, fill = line), position = &#39;dodge&#39;, bins = 10) + scale_x_log10() ## Warning: Transformation introduced infinite values in continuous x-axis ## Warning: Removed 11944 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). If you want to group by more than one variable, facets are good: ggplot(data = delay_2019) + geom_density(aes(x = min_delay, color = day), bw = .08) + scale_x_log10() + facet_grid(~line) ## Warning: Transformation introduced infinite values in continuous x-axis ## Warning: Removed 11944 rows containing non-finite values (stat_density). Side note: the station names are a mess. Try and clean up the station names a bit by taking just the first word (or, the first two if it starts with “ST”): delay_2019 &lt;- delay_2019 %&gt;% mutate(station_clean = ifelse(str_starts(station, &quot;ST&quot;), word(station, 1,2), word(station, 1))) Plot top five stations by mean delay: delay_2019 %&gt;% group_by(line, station_clean) %&gt;% summarise(mean_delay = mean(min_delay), n_obs = n()) %&gt;% filter(n_obs&gt;1) %&gt;% arrange(line, -mean_delay) %&gt;% slice(1:5) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(station_clean, mean_delay)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + facet_wrap(~line, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;) 19.5.5 Visualizing time series Daily plot is messy (you can check for yourself). Let’s look by week to see if there’s any seasonality. The lubridate package has lots of helpful functions that deal with date variables. First, mean delay (of those that were delayed more than 0 mins): delay_2019 %&gt;% filter(min_delay&gt;0) %&gt;% mutate(week = week(date)) %&gt;% group_by(week, line) %&gt;% summarise(mean_delay = mean(min_delay)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(week, mean_delay, color = line)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + facet_grid(~line) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; What about proportion of delays that were greater than 10 mins? delay_2019 %&gt;% mutate(week = week(date)) %&gt;% group_by(week, line) %&gt;% summarise(prop_delay = sum(min_delay&gt;10)/n()) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(week, prop_delay, color = line)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + facet_grid(~line) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; 19.5.6 Visualizing relationships Note that scatter plots are a good precursor to modeling, to visualize relationships between continuous variables. Nothing obvious to plot here, but easy to do with geom_point. Look at top five reasons for delay by station. Do they differ? Think about how this could be modeled. delay_2019 %&gt;% group_by(line, code_desc) %&gt;% summarise(mean_delay = mean(min_delay)) %&gt;% arrange(-mean_delay) %&gt;% slice(1:5) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = code_desc, y = mean_delay)) + geom_col() + facet_wrap(vars(line), scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, nrow = 4) + coord_flip() 19.5.7 PCA Principal components analysis is a really powerful exploratory tool. It allows you to pick up potential clusters and/or outliers that can help to inform model building. Let’s do a quick (and imperfect) example looking at types of delays by station. The delay categories are a bit of a mess, and there’s hundreds of them. As a simple start, let’s just take the first word: delay_2019 &lt;- delay_2019 %&gt;% mutate(code_red = case_when( str_starts(code_desc, &quot;No&quot;) ~ word(code_desc, 1, 2), str_starts(code_desc, &quot;Operator&quot;) ~ word(code_desc, 1,2), TRUE ~ word(code_desc,1)) ) Let’s also just restrict the analysis to causes that happen at least 50 times over 2019. To do the PCA, the dataframe also needs to be switched to wide format: dwide &lt;- delay_2019 %&gt;% group_by(line, station_clean) %&gt;% mutate(n_obs = n()) %&gt;% filter(n_obs&gt;1) %&gt;% group_by(code_red) %&gt;% mutate(tot_delay = n()) %&gt;% arrange(tot_delay) %&gt;% filter(tot_delay&gt;50) %&gt;% group_by(line, station_clean, code_red) %&gt;% summarise(n_delay = n()) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = code_red, values_from = n_delay) %&gt;% mutate_all(.funs = funs(ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))) ## `mutate_all()` ignored the following grouping variables: ## Columns `line`, `station_clean` ## Use `mutate_at(df, vars(-group_cols()), myoperation)` to silence the message. Do the PCA: delay_pca &lt;- prcomp(dwide[,3:ncol(dwide)]) df_out &lt;- as_tibble(delay_pca$x) df_out &lt;- bind_cols(dwide %&gt;% select(line, station_clean), df_out) head(df_out) ## # A tibble: 6 x 40 ## # Groups: line, station_clean [6] ## line station_clean PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 PC6 PC7 PC8 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 BD BATHURST 6.50 26.9 -2.71 -10.8 -8.40 -11.7 -3.33 -4.11 ## 2 BD BAY 24.8 7.63 -2.19 -7.05 0.714 3.90 -2.29 -4.14 ## 3 BD BLOOR -62.4 -112. 57.3 -23.4 -5.09 -14.1 13.7 5.06 ## 4 BD BROADVIEW -6.60 28.1 -1.06 -14.0 -6.49 -8.29 -6.29 -1.40 ## 5 BD CASTLE 23.8 11.8 -1.31 -7.93 -3.62 -3.37 -2.08 -3.48 ## 6 BD CHESTER 24.6 -1.87 -18.6 2.75 1.85 0.0736 3.79 -1.27 ## # … with 30 more variables: PC9 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC10 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC11 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC12 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # PC13 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC14 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC15 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC16 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC17 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC18 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # PC19 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC20 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC21 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC22 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC23 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC24 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # PC25 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC26 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC27 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC28 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC29 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC30 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # PC31 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC32 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC33 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC34 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC35 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC36 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # PC37 &lt;dbl&gt;, PC38 &lt;dbl&gt; Plot the first two PCs, and label some outlying stations: ggplot(df_out,aes(x=PC1,y=PC2,color=line )) + geom_point() + geom_text_repel(data = df_out %&gt;% filter(PC2&gt;100|PC1&lt;100*-1), aes(label = station_clean)) Plot the factor loadings.

(note: the 2014 file you will get from get_resource, so just keep the sheet that relates to the Mayor election). Clean up the data format (fixing the parsing issue and standardizing the column names using janitor) Summarize the variables in the dataset. Are there missing values, and if so, should we be worried about them? Is every variable in the format it should be? If not, create new variable(s) that are in the right format. Visually explore the distribution of values of the contributions. What contributions are notable outliers? Do they share a similar characteristic(s)? It may be useful to plot the distribution of contributions without these outliers to get a better sense of the majority of the data. List the top five candidates in each of these categories: total contributions mean contribution number of contributions Repeat 5 but without contributions from the candidates themselves.

Uncertainty. Threats to validity. Key libraries broom ggplot2 modelr tidyverse Key functions augment() glance() lm() tidy() Pre-quiz Please write a linear relationship between some response variable, Y, and some predictor, X. What is the intercept term? What is the slope term? What would adding a hat to these indicate? What is the least squares criterion? Similarly, what is RSS and what are we trying to do when we run least squares regression? What is bias? What is a confidence interval? If there were three variables: Snow, Temperature, and Wind, please write R code that would fit a simple linear regression to explain Snow as a function of Temperature and Wind. What do you think about another explanatory variable - daily stock market returns - to your model? 21.1 Introduction I am going to follow a combination of ISLR and R4DS. Sometimes the language that is used for specific terms differs over time and between disciplines. For instance, ISLR is written from a machine learning perspective, R4DS is written from a data science perspective, and if you come from a different discipline then the terminology may be slightly different. You’re welcome to use whatever you are comfortable with, but here I’ll follow ISLR and R4DS. If we have two variables, \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\), then we could characterise the relationship between these as: \\[Y \\sim \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X.\\] There are two coefficients/parameters, and the intercept is \\(\\beta_0\\), the slope is \\(\\beta_1\\). We are saying that \\(Y\\) will have some value, \\(\\beta_0\\), even when \\(X\\) is 0, and that \\(Y\\) will change by \\(\\beta_1\\) units for every one unit change in \\(X\\). We may then take this relationship to the data that we have about the relationship in order to estimate these coefficients for those particular values that we have: \\[\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x.\\] 21.2 Competing relationships I want to focus on data, so we’ll make this example concrete, by generating some data and then discussing everything in the context of that. The example will be looking at someone’s time for running five kilometers, compared with their time for running a marathon. library(tidyverse) set.seed(853) number_of_observations &lt;- 100 running_data &lt;- tibble(five_km_time = rnorm(number_of_observations, 20, 3), noise = rnorm(number_of_observations, 0, 10), marathon_time = five_km_time * 8.4 + noise, was_raining = sample(c(&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;), size = number_of_observations, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.8)) ) running_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = five_km_time, y = marathon_time)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Five km time (minutes)&quot;, y = &quot;Marathon time (minutes)&quot;) + theme_classic() In this set-up we may like to use \\(x\\), which is the five-kilometer time, to produce estimates of \\(y\\), which is the marathon time. This would involve also estimating values of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), which is why they have a hat on them. But how should we estimate the coefficients? Even if we impose a linear relationship there are a lot of options, but here are some: # This great idea of showing some possible fits is from Wickham, Hadley, and Garrett Grolemund, 2017. set.seed(853) models &lt;- tibble( a1 = runif(750, -40, 400), a2 = runif(750, -16, 16) ) ggplot() + geom_abline(data = models, aes(intercept = a1, slope = a2), alpha = 1/4) + geom_point(data = running_data, aes(x = five_km_time, y = marathon_time)) + labs(x = &quot;five-kilometer time (minutes)&quot;, y = &quot;Marathon time (minutes)&quot;) + theme_classic() Clearly some of these fits are not all that great. One way we may define being great would be to impose that they be as close as possible to each of the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) combinations that we know. One way is to choose the one that minimises the sum of least squares. To do this we produce our estimates of \\(\\hat{y}\\) based on some estimates of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\), given the \\(x\\), and then work out how ‘wrong’, for every point \\(i\\), we were: \\[ e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i.\\] The residual sum of squares (RSS) then requires summing across all the points: \\[ \\mbox{RSS} = e^2_1+ e^2_2 +\\dots + e^2_n.\\] This results in one ‘linear best-fit’ line, but it is worth thinking about all of the assumptions and decisions that it took to get us to this point. running_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = five_km_time, y = marathon_time)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE, color = &quot;black&quot;, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;five-kilometer time (minutes)&quot;, y = &quot;Marathon time (minutes)&quot;) + theme_classic() With the least squares criterion we want the values of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) that result in the smallest RSS. 21.3 Implementing this in R Within R, the main function for doing linear regression is lm. This is included in base R, so you don’t need to call any packages, but in a moment we will call a bunch of packages that will surround lm within an environment that we are more familiar with. You specify the relationship with the dependent variable first, then ~, then the independent variables. Finally, you should specify the dataset (or you could pipe to it as usual). lm(y ~ x, data = dataset) In general, you should assign this to an object: running_data_first_model &lt;- lm(marathon_time ~ five_km_time, data = running_data) To see the result of your regression you can then call summary(). summary(running_data_first_model) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = marathon_time ~ five_km_time, data = running_data) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -24.763 -5.686 0.722 6.650 16.707 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) 0.4114 6.0610 0.068 0.946 ## five_km_time 8.3617 0.3058 27.343 &lt;2e-16 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Residual standard error: 8.474 on 98 degrees of freedom ## Multiple R-squared: 0.8841, Adjusted R-squared: 0.8829 ## F-statistic: 747.6 on 1 and 98 DF, p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16 The first part of the result tells us the regression that we called, then information about the residuals, and the estimated coefficients. And then finally some useful diagnostics. We are considering that there is some relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) - \\(Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\) - and we are going to say that function is linear and so our relationship is: \\[\\hat{Y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon.\\] There is some ‘true’ relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), but we don’t know what it is. All we can do is use our sample of data to try to estimate it. But because our understanding depends on that sample, for every possible sample, we would get a slightly different relationship (as measured by the coefficients). That \\(\\epsilon\\) is a measure of our error - what does the model not know? There’s going to be plenty that the model doesn’t know, but we hope is that the error does not depend on \\(X\\). The intercept is marathon time that we would expect with a five-kilometer time of 0 minutes. Hopefully this example illustrates the need to carefully interpret the intercept coefficient! The coefficient on five-kilometer run time shows how we expect the marathon time to change if five-kilometer run time changed by one unit. In this case it’s about 8.4, which makes sense seeing as a marathon is roughly that many times longer than a five-kilometer run. 21.4 Tidy up with broom While there is nothing wrong with the base approach, I want to introduce the broom package because that will provide us with outputs in a tidy framework. There are three key functions: tidy: Gives the coefficient estimates in a tidy output. glance: Gives the diagnostics. augment: Adds the forecasted values, and hence, residuals, to your dataset. library(broom) tidy(running_data_first_model) ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 0.411 6.06 0.0679 9.46e- 1 ## 2 five_km_time 8.36 0.306 27.3 1.17e-47 glance(running_data_first_model) ## # A tibble: 1 x 11 ## r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik AIC BIC ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.884 0.883 8.47 748. 1.17e-47 2 -355. 715. 723. ## # … with 2 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt; Notice how the results are fairly similar to the base summary function. running_data &lt;- augment(running_data_first_model, data = running_data) We could now make plots of the residuals. ggplot(running_data, aes(x = .resid)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + theme_classic() + labs(y = &quot;Number of occurrences&quot;, x = &quot;Residuals&quot;) ggplot(running_data, aes(five_km_time, .resid)) + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = &quot;dotted&quot;, color = &quot;grey&quot;) + theme_classic() + labs(y = &quot;Residuals&quot;, x = &quot;five-kilometer time (minutes)&quot;) When we say our estimate is unbiased we are trying to say that even though with some sample our estimate might be too high, and with another sample our estimate might be too low, eventually if we have a lot of data then our estimate would be the same as the population. (A pro hockey player may sometimes shoot right of the net, and sometimes left of the net, but we’d hope that on average they’d be right in the middle of the net ;)). TODO: Add my favourite graph But we want to try to speak to the ‘true’ relationship, so we need to try to capture how much we think our understanding depends on the particular sample that we have to analyse. And this is where standard error comes in. It tells us how off our estimate is compared with the actual. From standard errors, we can compute a confidence interval. A 95 per cent confidence interval means that there is a 0.95 probability that the interval happens to contain the population parameter (which is typically unknown). running_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = five_km_time, y = marathon_time)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = TRUE, color = &quot;black&quot;, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;five-kilometer time (minutes)&quot;, y = &quot;Marathon time (minutes)&quot;) + theme_classic() 21.5 Testing hypothesis Now that we have an interval for which we can say there is a 95 per cent probability it contains the true population parameter we can test claims. For instance, a null hypothesis that there is no relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (i.e. \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)), compared with an alternative hypothesis that there is some relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (i.e. \\(\\beta_1 \\neq 0\\)). We need to know whether our estimate of \\(\\beta_1\\), which is \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\), is ‘far enough’ away from zero for us to be comfortable claiming that \\(\\beta_1 \\neq 0\\). How far is ‘far enough’? If we were very confident in our estimate of \\(\\beta_1\\) then it wouldn’t have to be far, but if we were not then it would have to be substantial. So it depends on a bunch of things, but essentially the standard error of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\). We compare this standard error with \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) to get the t-statistic: \\[t = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_1 - 0}{\\mbox{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_1)}.\\] And we then compare our t-statistic to the t-distribution to compute the probability of getting this absolute t-statistic or a larger one, if \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\). This is the p-value. A small p-value means it is unlikely that we would observe our association due to chance if there wasn’t a relationship. 21.6 Adding more and varied explanatory variables To this point we’ve just considered one explanatory variable. But we’ll usually have more than one. One approach would be to run separate regressions for each explanatory variable. But compared with separate linear regressions for each, adding more explanatory variables allows us to have a better understanding of the intercept and accounts for interaction. Often the results will be quite different. This slightly counterintuitive result is very common in many real life situations. Consider an absurd example to illustrate the point. Running a regression of shark attacks versus ice cream sales for data collected at a given beach community over a period of time would show a positive relationship, similar to that seen between sales and newspapers. Of course no one (yet) has suggested that ice creams should be banned at beaches to reduce shark attacks. In reality, higher temperatures cause more people to visit the beach, which in turn results in more ice cream sales and mores hark attacks. A multiple regression of attacks versus ice cream sales and temperature reveals that, as intuition implies, the former predictor is no longer significant after adjusting for temperature. James, Gareth, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, 2017, p. 74. We may also like to consider variables that do not have an inherent ordering. For instance, pregnant or not. When there are only two options then we can use a binary variable which is 0 or 1. If there are more than two levels then use a combination of binary variables, where the ‘missing’ outcome (baseline) gets pushed onto the intercept. In other languages you may need to explicitly construct dummy variables, but as R was designed as a language to do statistical programming, it does a lot of the work here for you and is fairly forgiving. For instance, if you have a column of character values that only had two values: c(&quot;Monica&quot;, &quot;Rohan&quot;, &quot;Rohan&quot;, &quot;Monica&quot;, &quot;Monica&quot;, &quot;Rohan&quot;), and you used this as a independent variable in your usual regression set up then R would treat it as a dummy variable. running_data_rain_model &lt;- lm(marathon_time ~ five_km_time + was_raining, data = running_data) summary(running_data_rain_model) The result probably isn’t too surprising if we look at a plot of the data. running_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = five_km_time, y = marathon_time, color = was_raining)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE, color = &quot;black&quot;, linetype = &quot;dashed&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;five-kilometer time (minutes)&quot;, y = &quot;Marathon time (minutes)&quot;, color = &quot;Was raining&quot;) + theme_classic() + scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) In addition to wanting to include additional explanatory variables we may think that they are related with one another. For instance, if we were wanting to explain the amount of snowfall in Toronto, then we may be interested in the humidity and the temperature, but those two variables may also interact. We can do this by using * instead of + when we specify the model in R. If you do interact variables, then you should almost always also include the individual variables as well (Figure 21.1). Figure 21.1: Don’t leave out the main effects in an interactive model Source: By Kai Arzheimer, 16 February 2020. 21.7 Threats to validity and aspects to think about There are a variety of weaknesses and aspects that you should discuss when you use linear regression. A quick list includes (James, Gareth, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, 2017, p. 92): Non-linearity of the response-predictor relationships. Correlation of error terms. Non-constant variance of error terms. Outliers. High-leverage points. Collinearity These are also aspects that you should discuss if you use linear regression. Including plots tends to be handy here to illustrate your points. Other aspects that you may consider discussing include (James, Gareth, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, 2017, p. 75): Is at least one of the predictors \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p\\) useful in predicting the response? Do all the predictors help to explain \\(Y\\), or is only a subset of the predictors useful? How well does the model fit the data? Given a set of predictor values, what response value should we predict, and how accurate is our prediction? 21.8 More credible outputs Finally, after creating beautiful graphs and tables you may want your regression output to look just as nice. There are a variety of packages in R that will automatically format your regression outputs. You should try huxtable. library(huxtable) huxreg(running_data_first_model) (1) (Intercept) 0.411&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6.061)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; five_km_time 8.362 *** (0.306)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R2 0.884&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; logLik -354.584&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AIC 715.168&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *** p &lt; 0.001; ** p &lt; 0.01; * p &lt; 0.05.

For simplicity, we’ll use the .pdf questionnaire that accompanies this dataset from the Toronto Open Data website. Alternatively, we could get and parse the readme through the R package. Here’s a link to the questionnaire. Question 1 indicates the level of support for a casino in Toronto. We’ll use this as the response variable. Concerning potential predictor variables, most of the questions ask respondents about their opinions on different aspects of a potential casino development, which aren’t particularly useful towards our cause. The only demographic variables are Age and Gender, so let’s choose these. Here I’m also going to rename the columns so that my resulting data frame has columns opinion, age, and gender. # Narrow down the dataframe to our variables of interest casino_data &lt;- casino_data %&gt;% select(Q1_A, Age, Gender) %&gt;% rename(opinion = Q1_A, age = Age, gender = Gender) # Look at first couple rows: head(casino_data) opinion age gender Strongly Opposed 25-34 Male Strongly in Favour 35-44 Female Strongly in Favour 55-64 Male Somewhat Opposed 25-34 Male Neutral or Mixed Feelings 25-34 Female Strongly Opposed 45-54 Female 25.2 Some visual exploration (and more cleanup, of course) Let’s first do some quick exploration to get a feel for what’s going on in the data. We’ll first calculate proportions of casino support for each age-gender combination: # Calculate proportions casino_summary &lt;- casino_data %&gt;% group_by(age, gender, opinion) %&gt;% summarise(n = n()) %&gt;% # Count the number in each group and response group_by(age, gender) %&gt;% mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) # Calculate proportions within each group Some notes: * we use geom_col() to make a bar chart, * facet_grid() modifies the plot so that the plot has panels that correspond only to certain values of discrete variables (in this case, we will “facet” by age and gender). This is helpful in this case because we are interested in how the distribution of opinions changes by age and gender. ggplot(casino_summary) + geom_col(aes(x = opinion, y = prop)) + # Specify a histogram of opinion responses facet_grid(age~gender) + #Facet by age and gender theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) # Rotate the x-axis labels to be readable Some things to note: the x-axis labels are out of order in the sense that they are not in a monotone order of increasing/decreasing support there are NA values in opinion, age, and gender, as well as “Prefer not to disclose” responses 25.2.1 Getting the data into a more model-suitable format 25.2.1.1 Get rid of responses that aren’t suitable For simplicity we’ll assume that NA values and “Prefer not to disclose” responses occur randomly, and remove them from our dataset (note in reality this assumption might not hold up and we might want to be more careful). Let’s check how many rows are in the original dataset: # nrow() returns the number of rows in a dataframe: nrow(casino_data) ## [1] 17766 Now let’s filter() accordingly to omit the responses we don’t want. In case you’re unfamiliar, I’m going to make use of: is.na(), which returns TRUE if the argument is NA, the ! operator, which flips TRUE and FALSE. So for instance, !is.na(x) will return TRUE if x is NOT NA, which is what we want to keep. casino_data &lt;- casino_data %&gt;% # Only keep rows with non-NA: filter(!is.na(opinion), !is.na(age), !is.na(gender)) %&gt;% # Only keep rows where age and gender are disclosed: filter(age != &quot;Prefer not to disclose&quot;, gender != &quot;Prefer not to disclose&quot;) Let’s check how many rows of data we’re left with: nrow(casino_data) ## [1] 13658 25.2.1.2 Convert response variable into binary To clean up the first problem (response variables out of order), we might as well take this opportunity to convert these into a format suitable for our model. In a logistic regression, we would like our response variable to be binary, but in this case we have 5 possible categories ranging from “Strongly Opposed” to “Strongly in Favour”. We’ll recategorize them into a new supportive_or_not variable as follows. supportive = 1 if “Strongly in Favour” or “Somewhat in Favour” supportive = 0 if “Neutral or Mixed Feelings”, “Somewhat Opposed”, or “Strongly Opposed” We do this with the mutate() function, which creates new columns (possibly as functions of existing columns), and case_when(), which provides a way to assign values conditional on if-statements. The syntax here is a little strange. On the LHS of the ~ is the “if” condition, and the RHS of the tilde is the value to return. For example, x == 0 ~ 3 would return 3 when x is 0. Another commonly used operator here is the %in% operator, which checks whether something is an element of a vector. E.g.: 1 %in% c(1, 3, 4) returns TRUE 2 %in% c(1, 3, 4) returns FALSE # Store possible opinions in vectors yes_opinions &lt;- c(&quot;Strongly in Favour&quot;, &quot;Somewhat in Favour&quot;) no_opinions &lt;- c(&quot;Neutral or Mixed Feelings&quot;, &quot;Somewhat Opposed&quot;, &quot;Strongly Opposed&quot;) # Create `supportive` column: casino_data &lt;- casino_data %&gt;% mutate(supportive = case_when( opinion %in% yes_opinions ~ TRUE, # Assign TRUE opinion %in% no_opinions ~ FALSE # Assign FALSE )) 25.2.1.3 Convert age to a numeric variable Age in this survey is given in age groups. Let’s instead treat it map it to a numeric variable so that we can more easily talk about trends with age. We’ll map the youngest age to 1, and so on: casino_data &lt;- casino_data %&gt;% mutate(age_group = case_when( age == &quot;Under 15&quot; ~ 0, age == &quot;15-24&quot; ~ 1, age == &quot;25-34&quot; ~ 2, age == &quot;35-44&quot; ~ 3, age == &quot;45-54&quot; ~ 4, age == &quot;55-64&quot; ~ 5, age == &quot;65 or older&quot; ~ 6 )) Now let’s make the same plot again, with our new processed data: casino_summary2 &lt;- casino_data %&gt;% group_by(age_group, gender, supportive) %&gt;% summarise(n = n()) %&gt;% # Count the number in each group and response group_by(age_group, gender) %&gt;% mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) # Calculate proportions within each group ggplot(casino_summary2) + facet_grid(age_group ~ gender) + geom_col(aes(x = supportive, y = prop)) We can sort of see some difference in the distribution between different panels. To formalize this, we can run a logistic regression. 25.3 Logistic Regression Now, we’re set up to feed it to the regression. We can do this with glm(), which allows us to fit generalized linear models. We use family = &quot;binomial&quot; to specify a logistic regression, and our formula is supportive ~ age_group + gender, which indicates that supportive is the (binary) response variable since it’s on the LHS, and age_group and gender are our predictor variables. casino_glm &lt;- glm(supportive ~ age_group + gender, data = casino_data, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) We can take a look at the results of running the GLM using summary(): summary(casino_glm) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = supportive ~ age_group + gender, family = &quot;binomial&quot;, ## data = casino_data) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.0107 -0.8888 -0.6804 1.4249 1.8822 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Here are some important things to note about our results: 25.3.1.1 Numeric age group variable Remember that we coded age_group as numbers 1 to 5. Because we’ve used age groups instead of age, we have to be careful with how we phrase our conclusion. The coefficient estimate corresponds to the effect of moving up a unit on the age group scale (e.g. from the 25-34 age group to the 35-44 age group), rather than 1 year in age (e.g. from age 28 to 29). 25.3.1.2 log-odds ratios The effect estimates are on the log-odds scale. This means the effect of -0.07983 for age_group is interpreted as: for each unit increase in age_group, we estimate a 0.07983 decrease in the log-odds of being supportive of a casino. We could exponentiate the coefficient estimate to make this at least a little easier to interpret. The number we get is interpreted as a factor for the odds. exp(-0.07983) ## [1] 0.9232733 So our (cleaner) interpretation is: the odds of an individuals of the same gender being pro-casino are predicted to change by a factor of 0.9232733 for each unit increase in age_group 25.3.2 Baseline category First, note that because we have categorical variables, the gender coefficients are relative to a “baseline” category. The value of gender that doesn’t appear in the table, Female, is implicitly used as our baseline gender category. Technical note: if the variable is stored as a character class, then glm() will choose the alphabetically first value to use as the baseline. exp(0.70036) ## [1] 2.014478 So, the interpretation of the genderMale coefficient is: the odds of a male individual supporting a casino is 2.0144778 times higher than a female individual of the same age_group. 25.3.3 Making estimates 25.3.3.1 A manual way Using the formula found in ISLR 4.3.3, we can make estimates for an individual of certain characteristics. Suppose we wanted to predict the the probability of supporting a Toronto casino for an individual who was 36 and identified as transgender. Then: age_group takes a value of 3, since they are in the age group of 35-44 coded as 3, genderTransgendered takes a value of 1 First, let’s extract the coefficient estimates as a vector using coefficients(): coefs &lt;- coefficients(casino_glm) coefs ## (Intercept) age_group genderMale genderTransgendered ## -1.10593925 -0.07983372 0.70036199 0.69022910 Since this vector is labelelled, we can index it using square brackets and names. For instance: coefs[&quot;age_group&quot;] ## age_group ## -0.07983372 So first let’s evaluate the exponent term \\(e^{\\beta_0 + \\cdots + \\beta_p X_p}\\): exp_term &lt;- exp(coefs[&quot;(Intercept)&quot;] + coefs[&quot;age_group&quot;]*3 + coefs[&quot;genderTransgendered&quot;]*1) Now evaluate the expression that gives the probability of casino support: # The unname() command just takes off the label that it &quot;inherited&quot; from the coefs vector. # (don&#39;t worry about it, doesn&#39;t affect any functionality) unname(exp_term / (1 + exp_term)) ## [1] 0.3418161 25.3.3.2 A more streamlined way Thankfully R comes with a convenient function to make prediction estimates from a glm(). We do this using the predict() function. First, we need to make a dataframe that has the relevant variables and values that we’re interested in predicting. We’ll use the same values as before: prediction_df &lt;- data.frame(age_group = 3, gender = &quot;Transgendered&quot;) The dataframe looks like this: prediction_df age_group gender 3 Transgendered Then we feed it into the predict() function, along with our glm object. To get the probability, we need to specify type = &quot;response&quot;. predict(casino_glm, newdata = prediction_df, type = &quot;response&quot;) ## 1 ## 0.3418161 This matches the probability we got from doing this manually, yay!

We can give read_csv() a link to where the dataset is and it will download it. This helps with reproducibility because the source is clear. But, as that link could change at any time, longer-term reproducibility, as well as wanting to minimise the effect on the Inside Airbnb servers, suggest that we should also save a local copy of the data and then use that. (As the original data is not ours, we should not make that public without first getting written permission.) # For reproducibility # airbnb_data_reduced &lt;- read_csv(&quot;http://data.insideairbnb.com/canada/on/toronto/2019-12-07/data/listings.csv.gz&quot;, guess_max = 20000) # write_csv(airbnb_data_reduced, &quot;week_6/data/airbnb_toronto_2019-12-07.csv&quot;) # For actual work airbnb_data &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;inputs/data/airbnb_toronto_2019-12-07.csv&quot;), guess_max = 20000) # The guess_max option in read_csv helps us avoid having to specify the column types. Usually read_csv takes a best guess at the column types based on the first few rows. But sometimes those first ones are misleading and so guess_max forces it to look at a larger number of rows to try to work out what is going on. 26.4 Clean data There are an enormous number of columns, so we’ll just select a few. names(airbnb_data) %&gt;% length() ## [1] 106 airbnb_data_selected &lt;- airbnb_data %&gt;% select(host_id, host_since, host_response_time, host_is_superhost, host_listings_count, host_total_listings_count, host_neighbourhood, host_listings_count, neighbourhood_cleansed, room_type, bathrooms, bedrooms, square_feet, price, number_of_reviews, has_availability, review_scores_rating, review_scores_accuracy, review_scores_cleanliness, review_scores_checkin, review_scores_communication, review_scores_location, review_scores_value ) We might like to have a brief look at the dataset to see if anything weird is going on. There are a bunch of ways of doing this, but one way is ‘skim’ from the skimr package (Waring, Quinn, McNamara, Arino de la Rubia, Zhu and Ellis, 2020). # skim(airbnb_data_selected) A few things jump out: There are a character variables that should probably be numerics or dates/times: host_response_time, price, weekly_price, monthly_price, cleaning_fee. Weekly and monthly price is missing in an overwhelming number of observations. Roughly a fifth of observations are missing a review score and there seems like there is some correlation between those review-type variables. There are two variants of the neighbourhood name. There are NAs in host_is_superhost. The reviews seem really skewed. There is someone who has 328 properties on Airbnb. 26.4.1 Price First we need to convert to a numeric. This is a common problem, and you need to be a little careful that it doesn’t all just convert to NAs. In our case if we just force the price data to be a numeric then it will go to NA because there are a lot of characters that R doesn’t know how to convert, e.g. what is the numeric for ‘$’? So we need to remove those characters first. airbnb_data_selected$price %&gt;% head() ## [1] &quot;$469.00&quot; &quot;$99.00&quot; &quot;$66.00&quot; &quot;$72.00&quot; &quot;$199.00&quot; &quot;$54.00&quot; # First work out what is going on airbnb_data_selected$price %&gt;% str_split(&quot;&quot;) %&gt;% unlist() %&gt;% unique() ## [1] &quot;$&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;9&quot; &quot;.&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;8&quot; &quot;,&quot; # It&#39;s clear that &#39;$&#39; needs to go.

Once a host reaches Superhost status, a badge superhost badge will automatically appear on their listing and profile to help you identify them. We check Superhosts’ activity four times a year, to ensure that the program highlights the people who are most dedicated to providing outstanding hospitality.

Hosts can view their star ratings on their Progress page, under Reviews. Hosts using professional hosting tools can find reviews and quality details on their Performance page, under Quality. Guests can give ratings on: Overall experience. Overall, how was the stay? Cleanliness. Did guests feel that the space was clean and tidy? Accuracy. How accurately did the listing page represent the space? For example, guests should be able to find up-to-date info and photos in the listing description. Value. Did the guest feel that the listing provided good value for the price? Communication. How well did you communicate before and during the stay? Guests often care that their host responds quickly, reliably, and frequently to their messages and questions. Check-in. How smoothly did check-in go? Location. How did guests feel about the neighbourhood? This may mean that there’s an accurate description for proximity and access to transportation, shopping centres, city centre, etc., and a description that includes special considerations, like noise, and family safety. Amenities. How did guests feel about the amenities that were available during their stay? Guests often care that all the amenities listed are available, working, and in good condition. In each category, hosts are able to see how often they get 5 stars, how guests rated nearby hosts, and, in some cases, tips to help improve the listing. The number of stars displayed at the top of a listing page is an aggregate of the primary scores guests have given for that listing. At the bottom of a listing page, there’s an aggregate for each category rating. A host needs to receive star ratings from at least 3 guests before their aggregate score appears. TODO: I don’t understand how these review scores are being constructed. Airbnb says it’s a star rating, but how are they converting this into the 10 point scale, similarly, how are their constructing the overall one, which seems to be out of 100? There’s a lot of clumping around 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 - could they be averaging a five-star scale and then rebasing it to 100? Now we’ll deal with the NAs in review_scores_rating. This one is more complicated as there are a lot of them. airbnb_data_selected %&gt;% filter(is.na(review_scores_rating)) host_id host_since host_response_time host_is_superhost host_listings_count host_total_listings_count host_neighbourhood neighbourhood_cleansed room_type bathrooms bedrooms square_feet price number_of_reviews has_availability review_scores_rating review_scores_accuracy review_scores_cleanliness review_scores_checkin review_scores_communication review_scores_location review_scores_value host_is_superhost_binary 4.82e+04 2009-10-25 N/A FALSE 1 1 The Annex Annex Private room 1.5 1 120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, it’s a large proportion of the total - almost a fifth of properties don’t have any reviews (hence an NA in review_scores_rating). We can use vis_miss from the visdat package (Tierney, 2017) to make sure that all components of the review are missing. If the NAs are being driven by the Airbnb requirement of at least three reviews then we would expect they would all be missing. # We&#39;ll just check whether this is the same for all of the different variants of reviews airbnb_data_selected %&gt;% select(review_scores_rating, review_scores_accuracy, review_scores_cleanliness, review_scores_checkin, review_scores_communication, review_scores_location, review_scores_value) %&gt;% vis_miss() It looks pretty convincing that in almost all cases, all the different variants of reviews are missing. So let’s just focus on the main review. airbnb_data_selected %&gt;% filter(!is.na(review_scores_rating)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = review_scores_rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + theme_classic() + labs(x = &quot;Average review score&quot;, y = &quot;Number of properties&quot;) It’s pretty clear that almost all the reviews are more than 80. Let’s just zoom in on that 60 to 80 range to check what the distribution looks like in that range. airbnb_data_selected %&gt;% filter(!is.na(review_scores_rating)) %&gt;% filter(review_scores_rating &gt; 60) %&gt;% filter(review_scores_rating &lt; 80) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = review_scores_rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + theme_classic() + labs(x = &quot;Average review score&quot;, y = &quot;Number of properties&quot;) 26.4.4 Response time Airbnb says that: Hosts have 24 hours to officially accept or decline reservation requests. You’ll be updated by email about the status of your request. More than half of all reservation requests are accepted within one hour of being received. The vast majority of hosts reply within 12 hours. If a host confirms your request, your payment is processed and collected by Airbnb in full. If a host declines your request or the request expires, we don’t process your payment. TODO: I don’t understand how you can get a response time of NA? It must be related to some other variable. Looking now at response time: table(airbnb_data_selected$host_response_time) ## ## a few days or more N/A within a day within a few hours ## 321 6324 1584 2542 ## within an hour ## 12341 Interestingly it seems like what looks like ‘NAs’ in the host_response_time variable are not being coded as proper NAs, but are instead being treated as another category. We’ll recode them to be actual NAs. airbnb_data_selected$host_response_time[airbnb_data_selected$host_response_time == &quot;N/A&quot;] &lt;- NA So here we clearly have issues with NAs. We probably want to filter them away for this example because it’s just a quick example, but there are an awful lot of them (more than 20 per cent) so we’ll have a quick look at them in relation to the review score. airbnb_data_selected %&gt;% filter(is.na(host_response_time)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = review_scores_rating)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) ## Warning: Removed 2313 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).

Some aspects that come to mind is looking at prices and reviews and super hosts, and number of properties and neighbourhood. TODO: Come back and make this paragraph better. 26.5.1 Price and reviews Look at the relationship between price and reviews, and whether they are a super-host. # Look at both price and reviews airbnb_data_filtered %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = price, y = review_scores_rating, color = host_is_superhost)) + geom_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.1) + # Make the points smaller and more transparent as they overlap considerably. theme_classic() + labs(x = &quot;Price per night&quot;, y = &quot;Average review score&quot;, color = &quot;Super host&quot;) + # Probably should recode this to more meaningful than TRUE/FALSE. scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) 26.5.2 Superhost and response-time One of the aspects that may make someone a super host is how quickly they respond to enquiries. One could imagine that being a superhost involves quickly saying yes or no to enquiries. Let’s look at the data. First, we want to look at the possible values of superhost by their response times. airbnb_data_filtered %&gt;% tabyl(host_is_superhost) %&gt;% adorn_totals(&quot;row&quot;) %&gt;% adorn_pct_formatting() host_is_superhost n percent FALSE 2.62e+03 53.6% TRUE 2.26e+03 46.4% Total 4.88e+03 100.0% Fortunately, it looks like when we removed the reviews rows we removed any NAs from whether they were a super host, but if we go back and look into that we may need to check again. The tabyl function within the janitor package (Firke, 2020) would list the NAs if there were any, but in case you don’t trust it, another way of check this is to try to filter to just the NAs. airbnb_data_filtered %&gt;% filter(is.na(host_is_superhost)) ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf ## Warning in max(nchar(as.character(col), type = &quot;width&quot;)): no non-missing ## arguments to max; returning -Inf host_id host_since host_response_time host_is_superhost host_total_listings_count host_neighbourhood neighbourhood_cleansed room_type bathrooms bedrooms square_feet price number_of_reviews has_availability review_scores_rating review_scores_accuracy review_scores_cleanliness review_scores_checkin review_scores_communication review_scores_location review_scores_value host_is_superhost_binary Now let’s look at the response time. airbnb_data_filtered %&gt;% tabyl(host_response_time) %&gt;% adorn_totals(&quot;row&quot;) %&gt;% adorn_pct_formatting() host_response_time n percent a few days or more 78&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.6% within a day 538&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.0% within a few hours 833&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.1% within an hour 3.43e+03 70.3% Total 4.88e+03 100.0% So a vast majority respond within an hour. Finally, we can look at the cross-tab. airbnb_data_filtered %&gt;% tabyl(host_response_time, host_is_superhost) %&gt;% adorn_percentages(&quot;row&quot;) %&gt;% adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0) %&gt;% adorn_ns() %&gt;% adorn_title() host_is_superhost host_response_time FALSE TRUE a few days or more 92% (72) 8% (6) within a day 74% (396) 26% (142) within a few hours 60% (502) 40% (331) within an hour 48% (1647) 52% (1784) So if someone doesn’t respond within an hour then it’s unlikely that they are a super host. 26.5.3 Neighbourhood Finally, let’s look at neighbourhood. The data provider has attempted to clean the neighbourhood variable for us, so we’ll just use this for now. If we were doing this analysis properly, we’d need to check whether they’d made any mistakes. # We expect something in the order of 100 to 150 neighbourhoods, with the top ten accounting for a large majority of listings. airbnb_data_filtered %&gt;% tabyl(neighbourhood_cleansed) %&gt;% adorn_totals(&quot;row&quot;) %&gt;% adorn_pct_formatting() %&gt;% nrow() ## [1] 139 airbnb_data_filtered %&gt;% tabyl(neighbourhood_cleansed) %&gt;% adorn_pct_formatting() %&gt;% arrange(-n) %&gt;% filter(n &gt; 100) %&gt;% adorn_totals(&quot;row&quot;) %&gt;% head() neighbourhood_cleansed n percent Waterfront Communities-The Island 1e+03 20.5% Niagara 273 5.6% Church-Yonge Corridor 176 3.6% Annex 174 3.6% Dovercourt-Wallace Emerson-Junction 163 3.3% Bay Street Corridor 130 2.7% 26.6 Model data We will now run some models on our dataset. We will first split the data into test/training groups, we do this using functions from the tidymodels package (Kuhn and Wickham, 2019) (which like the tidyverse package (Wickham et al., 2019) is a package of packages). set.seed(853) airbnb_data_filtered_split &lt;- airbnb_data_filtered %&gt;% initial_split(prop = 3/4) airbnb_train &lt;- training(airbnb_data_filtered_split) airbnb_test &lt;- testing(airbnb_data_filtered_split) rm(airbnb_data_filtered_split) 26.6.1 Logistic regression We may like to look at whether we can forecast whether someone is a super host, and the factors that go into explaining that. As the dependent variable is binary, this is a good opportunity to look at logistic regression. We expect that better reviews will be associated with faster responses and higher reviews. Specifically, the model that we estimate is: \\[\\mbox{Prob(Is super host} = 1) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\mbox{Response time} + \\beta_2 \\mbox{Reviews} + \\epsilon\\] We estimate the model using glm in the R language (R Core Team, 2019). logistic_reg_superhost_response_review &lt;- glm(host_is_superhost ~ host_response_time + review_scores_rating, data = airbnb_train, family = binomial ) We can have a quick look at the results, for instance, the summary function. We could also use tidy or glance from the broom package (Robinson and Hayes, 2020). The details should be the same, but the broom functions are tibbles, which means that we can more easily deal with them within a tidy framework. summary(logistic_reg_superhost_response_review) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = host_is_superhost ~ host_response_time + review_scores_rating, ## family = binomial, data = airbnb_train) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.9513 -0.7401 -0.0529 0.8562 4.4894 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

We can do that in a variety of ways, but one way is to use augment from the broom package (Robinson and Hayes, 2020). This will add the prediction and associated uncertainty to the data. For every row we will then have the probability that our model is estimating that they are a superhost. But ultimately, we need a binary forecast. There are a bunch of different options, but one is to just say that if the model estimates a probability of more than 0.5 then we bin it into a superhost, and other not. airbnb_data_filtered_logistic_fit_train &lt;- augment(logistic_reg_superhost_response_review, data = airbnb_train %&gt;% select(host_is_superhost, host_is_superhost_binary, host_response_time, review_scores_rating ), type.predict = &quot;response&quot;) %&gt;% # We use the &quot;response&quot; option here so that the function does the work of worrying about the exponential and log odds for us. Our result will be a probability. select(-.hat, -.sigma, -.cooksd, -.std.resid) %&gt;% mutate(predict_host_is_superhost = if_else(.fitted &gt; 0.5, 1, 0), # How do things change if we change the 0.5 cutoff? host_is_superhost_binary = as.factor(host_is_superhost_binary), predict_host_is_superhost_binary = as.factor(predict_host_is_superhost) ) We can look at how far off the model is. There are a bunch of ways of doing this, but one is to look at what probability the model has given each person. airbnb_data_filtered_logistic_fit_train %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, fill = host_is_superhost_binary)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) + theme_classic() + labs(x = &quot;Estimated probability that host is super host&quot;, y = &quot;Number&quot;, fill = &quot;Host is super host&quot;) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) We can look at how the model probabilities change based on average review score, and their average time to respond. ggplot(airbnb_data_filtered_logistic_fit_train, aes(x = review_scores_rating, y = .fitted, color = host_response_time)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Average review score&quot;, y = &quot;Predicted probability of being a superhost&quot;, color = &quot;Host response time&quot;) + theme_classic() + scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) # What is missing from this graph? This nice thing about this graph is that it illustrates nicely the effect of a host having an average response time of, say, ‘within an hour’ compared with ‘within a few hours’. We can focus on how the model does in terms of raw classification using confusionMatrix from the caret package (Kuhn, 2020). This also gives a bunch of diagnostics (the help file explains what they are). In general, they suggest this isn’t the best model that’s ever existed. caret::confusionMatrix(data = airbnb_data_filtered_logistic_fit_train$predict_host_is_superhost_binary, reference = airbnb_data_filtered_logistic_fit_train$host_is_superhost_binary) ## Confusion Matrix and Statistics ## ## Reference ## Prediction 0 1 ## 0 1502 341 ## 1 472 1345 ## ## Accuracy : 0.7779 ## 95% CI : (0.764, 0.7912) ## No Information Rate : 0.5393 ## P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : &lt; 2.2e-16 ## ## Kappa : 0.5555 ## ## Mcnemar&#39;s Test P-Value : 5.132e-06 ## ## Sensitivity : 0.7609 ## Specificity : 0.7977 ## Pos Pred Value : 0.8150 ## Neg Pred Value : 0.7402 ## Prevalence : 0.5393 ## Detection Rate : 0.4104 ## Detection Prevalence : 0.5036 ## Balanced Accuracy : 0.7793 ## ## &#39;Positive&#39; Class : 0 ## In any case, to this point we’ve been looking at how the model has done on the training set. It’s also relevant how it does on the test set. Again, there are a bunch of ways to do this, but one is to again use the augment function, but to include a newdata argument. airbnb_data_filtered_logistic_fit_test &lt;- augment(logistic_reg_superhost_response_review, data = airbnb_train %&gt;% select(host_is_superhost, host_is_superhost_binary, host_response_time, review_scores_rating ), newdata = airbnb_test %&gt;% select(host_is_superhost, host_is_superhost_binary, host_response_time, review_scores_rating ), # I&#39;m selecting just because the # dataset is quite wide, and so this makes it easier to look at. type.predict = &quot;response&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(predict_host_is_superhost = if_else(.fitted &gt; 0.5, 1, 0), host_is_superhost_binary = as.factor(host_is_superhost_binary), predict_host_is_superhost_binary = as.factor(predict_host_is_superhost) ) We would expect the performance to be slightly worse on the test set. But it’s actually fairly similar. caret::confusionMatrix(data = airbnb_data_filtered_logistic_fit_test$predict_host_is_superhost_binary, reference = airbnb_data_filtered_logistic_fit_test$host_is_superhost_binary) ## Confusion Matrix and Statistics ## ## Reference ## Prediction 0 1 ## 0 501 132 ## 1 142 445 ## ## Accuracy : 0.7754 ## 95% CI : (0.7509, 0.7986) ## No Information Rate : 0.527 ## P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : &lt;2e-16 ## ## Kappa : 0.5499 ## ## Mcnemar&#39;s Test P-Value : 0.5866 ## ## Sensitivity : 0.7792 ## Specificity : 0.7712 ## Pos Pred Value : 0.7915 ## Neg Pred Value : 0.7581 ## Prevalence : 0.5270 ## Detection Rate : 0.4107 ## Detection Prevalence : 0.5189 ## Balanced Accuracy : 0.7752 ## ## &#39;Positive&#39; Class : 0 ## We could compare the test with the training sets in terms of forecasts. training &lt;- airbnb_data_filtered_logistic_fit_train %&gt;% select(host_is_superhost_binary, .fitted) %&gt;% mutate(type = &quot;Training set&quot;) test &lt;- airbnb_data_filtered_logistic_fit_test %&gt;% select(host_is_superhost_binary, .fitted) %&gt;% mutate(type = &quot;Test set&quot;) both &lt;- rbind(training, test) rm(training, test) both %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, fill = host_is_superhost_binary)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) + theme_minimal() + labs(x = &quot;Estimated probability that host is super host&quot;, y = &quot;Number&quot;, fill = &quot;Host is super host&quot;) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) + facet_wrap(vars(type), nrow = 2, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;) HINT: How many aspects mentioned in the modelling criteria in rubric for PS3 have I gone through? 26.7 Next steps Ideas for the future: We could look at the relationship between superhosts and time - how long does it take to become one normally?

Key libraries broom ggplot2 tidyverse Key functions/etc aov() rnorm() sample() t.test() Pre-quiz In your own words, what is the role of randomisation in constructing a counterfactual? What is external validity? What is internal validity? If we have a dataset named ‘netflix_data’, with the columns ‘person’ and ‘tv_show’ and ‘hours’, (person is a character class uniqueID for every person, tv_show is a character class name of a tv show, and hours is double expressing the number of hours that person watched that tv show). Could you please write some code that would randomly assign people into one of two groups? The data looks like this: library(tidyverse) netflix_data &lt;- tibble(person = c(&quot;Rohan&quot;, &quot;Rohan&quot;, &quot;Monica&quot;, &quot;Monica&quot;, &quot;Monica&quot;, &quot;Patricia&quot;, &quot;Patricia&quot;, &quot;Helen&quot;), tv_show = c(&quot;Broadchurch&quot;, &quot;Duty-Shame&quot;, &quot;Broadchurch&quot;, &quot;Duty-Shame&quot;, &quot;Shetland&quot;, &quot;Broadchurch&quot;, &quot;Shetland&quot;, &quot;Duty-Shame&quot;), hours = c(6.8, 8.0, 0.8, 9.2, 3.2, 4.0, 0.2, 10.2) ) What does stratification mean to you (in the context of randomisation)? How could you check that your randomisation had been done appropriately? 27.1 Introduction First a note on Ronald Fisher and Francis Galton. Fisher and Galton are the intellectual grandfathers of much of the work that we cover in this chapter. In some cases it is directly their work, in other cases it is work that built on their contributions. Both of these men believed in eugenics, amongst other things that we would generally find reprehensible today. This chapter is about experiments. This is a situation in which we can explicitly control and vary some aspects. The advantage of this is that identification should be clear. There is a treatment group that is treated and a control group that is not. These are randomly split. And so if they end up different then it must be because of the treatment. Unfortunately, life is rarely so smooth. Arguing about how similar the treatment and control groups were tends to carry on indefinitely, because our ability to speak to internal validity affects our ability to speak to external validity. 27.2 Motivation Never forget: if your sampling is in any way non-representative, your observe[d] data is not sufficient for population estimates. You must deal with design, sampling issues, data quality, and misclassification. Otherwise you’ll just be wrong. Dan Simpson, 30 January 2020. When Monica and I moved to San Francisco, the Giants immediately won the baseball, and the Warriors began a historic streak. We moved to Chicago and the Cubs won the baseball for the first time in a hundred years. We then moved to Massachusetts, and the Patriots won the Super Bowl again and again and again. Finally, we moved to Toronto, and the Raptors won the basketball. Should a city pay us to live there or could their funds be better spent elsewhere? One way to get at the answer would be to run an experiment. Make a list of the North American cities with major sports teams, and then roll a dice and send us to live there for a year. If we had enough lifetimes, then we could work it out. But by using A/B testing and experiments we can try to use a larger sample size to work out causality a little more quickly. 27.3 Tea party Fisher introduced a, now, famous example of an experiment designed to see if a person can distinguish between a cup of tea when the milk was added first, or last (this matters a lot to my father). The set-up is: Eight randomly ordered cups of tea. Four had tea put in first. Four had milk put in first. The person has to choose the four that are the same. The person knows it’s an experiment. We’ll now try this experiment. To decide if the person’s choices were likely to have occured at random or not, we need to think about the probability of this happening by chance. First count the number of successes out of the four that were chosen. There are: \\({8 \\choose 4} = \\frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!}\\) 70 possible outcomes. By chance, there are two ways for the person to be perfectly correct (because we are only asking them to be grouped): correctly identify all the ones that were milk-first (one outcome out of 70) or correctly identify all the ones that were tea-first (one outcome out of 70), so the chance of that is \\(2/70 \\approx 0.028\\). So if the null is that they can’t distinguish, but they correctly separate them all, then at the five-per-cent level, we reject the null! What if they miss one? Similarly, by chance there are 16 ways for a person to be ‘off-by-one’. Either they think there was one that was milk-first when it was tea-first - there are, \\({4 \\choose 1}\\), four ways this could happen - or they think there was one that was tea-first when it was milk-first - again, there are, \\({4 \\choose 1}\\), four ways this could happen. But these outcomes are independent, so the probability is \\(\\frac{4\\times 4}{70} \\approx 0.228\\). And so on. So, we fail to reject the null. 27.4 Some unexpected properties from randomised sampling Correlation can be enough in some settings, but in order to be able to make forecasts when things change and the circumstances are slightly different we need to understand causation. The key is the counterfactual - what would have happened in the absence of the treatment. Ideally we could keep everything else constant, randomly divide the world into two groups, and then treat one and not the other. Then we can be pretty confident that any difference between the two groups is due to that treatment. The reason for this is that if we have some population and we randomly select two groups from it, then our two groups (so long as they are both big enough) should have the same characteristics as the population. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and A/B testing attempts to get us as close to this ‘gold standard’ as we can hope. (This is often described as the ‘gold standard’. In doing so, it’s not to say that it’s perfect, just that it’s generally better than most of the other options. There is plenty that is wrong with it.) To see this, let’s generate a simulated dataset and then sample from it. (In general, this is a good way to approach problems: 1) generate a simulated dataset; 2) do your analysis on the simulated dataset; 3) take your analysis to the real dataset. The reason this is a good approach is that you know roughly what the outcomes should be in step 2, whereas if you go directly to the real dataset then you don’t know if unexpected outcomes are likely due to your own analysis errors, or actual results. The first time you generate a simulated dataset it will take a while, but after a bit of practice you’ll get good at it. There are also packages that can help, including DeclareDesign.) library(tidyverse) set.seed(853) # Construct a population so that 25 per cent of people like blue and 75 per cent # like white. population &lt;- tibble(person = c(1:10000), favourite_color = sample(x = c(&quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;White&quot;), size = 10000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.25, 0.75)), supports_the_leafs = sample(x = c(&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;), size = 10000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.80, 0.20)), ) %&gt;% mutate(in_frame = sample(x = c(0:1), size = 10000, replace = TRUE)) %&gt;% mutate(group = sample(x = c(1:10), size = 10000, replace = TRUE)) %&gt;% mutate(group = ifelse(in_frame == 1, group, NA)) Now look at the mean for two groups drawn out of it. population %&gt;% filter(in_frame == 1) %&gt;% filter(group %in% c(1, 2)) %&gt;% group_by(group, favourite_color) %&gt;% count() ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## # Groups: group, favourite_color [4] ## group favourite_color n ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 Blue 114 ## 2 1 White 420 ## 3 2 Blue 105 ## 4 2 White 369 We are probably convinced by looking at it, but to formally test if there is a difference in the two samples, we can use a t-test. population &lt;- population %&gt;% mutate(color_as_integer = case_when( favourite_color == &quot;White&quot; ~ 0, favourite_color == &quot;Blue&quot; ~ 1, TRUE ~ 999 )) group_1 &lt;- population %&gt;% filter(group == 1) %&gt;% select(color_as_integer) %&gt;% as.vector() %&gt;% unlist() group_2 &lt;- population %&gt;% filter(group == 2) %&gt;% select(color_as_integer) %&gt;% unlist() t.test(group_1, group_2) ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: group_1 and group_2 ## t = -0.30825, df = 988.57, p-value = 0.758 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.05919338 0.04312170 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 0.2134831 0.2215190 # We could also use the tidy function in the broom package. tidy(t.test(group_1, group_2)) estimate estimate1 estimate2 statistic p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method alternative -0.00804 0.213 0.222 -0.308 0.758 989 -0.0592 0.0431 Welch Two Sample t-test two.sided If properly done then not only will we get a ‘representative’ share of people with the favourite color blue, but we should also get a representative share of people who support the Maple Leafs. Why should that happen when we haven’t randomised on these variables? Let’s start by looking at our dataset. population %&gt;% filter(in_frame == 1) %&gt;% filter(group %in% c(1, 2)) %&gt;% group_by(group, supports_the_leafs) %&gt;% count() ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## # Groups: group, supports_the_leafs [4] ## group supports_the_leafs n ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 1 No 102 ## 2 1 Yes 432 ## 3 2 No 81 ## 4 2 Yes 393 This is very powerful. We have a representative share on ‘unobservables’ (in this case we do ‘observe’ them - to illustrate the point - but we didn’t select on them). But it will break-down in a number of ways that we will discuss. It also assumes large enough groups - if we sampled in Toronto are we likely to get a ‘representative’ share of people who support the Canadiens? What about F.C. Hansa Rostock? If we want to check that the two groups are the same then what can we do? Exactly what we did above - just check if we can identify a difference between the two groups based on observables (we looked at the mean, but we could look at other aspects as well). 27.5 ANOVA Analysis of Variation (ANOVA) was introduced by Fisher while he was working on statistical problems in agriculture (to steal a joke from Darren L Dahly, cited in an earlier reading, “Q: What’s the difference between agricultural and medical research?” “A: The former isn’t conducted by farmers.”). Typically, the null is that all of the groups are from the same distribution. We can run ANOVA with the function built into R - aov(). just_two_groups &lt;- population %&gt;% filter(in_frame == 1) %&gt;% filter(group %in% c(1, 2)) aov(group ~ favourite_color, data = just_two_groups) %&gt;% tidy() term df sumsq meansq statistic p.value favourite_color 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.0238 0.0238 0.0952 0.758 Residuals 1.01e+03 251&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.25&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, we fail to reject the null that the samples are the same. 27.6 Treatment and control If the treated and control groups are the same in all ways and remain that way, then we have internal validity, which is to say that our control will work as a counterfactual and our results can speak to a difference between these groups. If the group to which we applied our randomisation were representative of the broader population, and the experimental set-up were fairly similar to outside conditions, then we further have external validity. That means that the difference that we find does not just apply in our own experiment, but also in the broader population. But this means we need randomisation twice. How does this trade-off happen and to what extent does it matter? As such, we are interested in the effect of being ‘treated’. This may be that we charge different prices (continuous treatment variable), or that we compare different colours on a website (discrete treatment variable, and a staple of A/B testing). If we consider just discrete treatments (so that we can use dummy variables) then need to make sure that all of the groups are otherwise the same. How can we do this? One way is to ignore the treatment variable and to examine all other variables - can you detect a difference between the groups based on any other variables? In the website example, are there a similar number of: PC/Mac users? Safari/Chrome/Firefox/other users? Mobile/desktop users? Users from certain locations? These are all threats to the validity of our claims. But if done properly, that is if the treatment is truly independent, then we can estimate an ‘average treatment effect’, which in a binary treatment variable setting is: \\[\\mbox{ATE} = \\mbox{E}[y|d=1] - \\mbox{E}[y|d=0].\\] That is, the difference between the treated group, \\(d = 1\\), and the control group, \\(d = 1\\), when measured by the expected value of some outcome variable, \\(y\\). So the mean causal effect is simply the difference between the two expectations! Let’s again get stuck into some code. First we need to generate some data. set.seed(853) example_data &lt;- tibble(person = c(1:1000), treatment = sample(x = 0:1, size = 1000, replace = TRUE) ) # We want to make the outcome slightly more likely if they were treated than if not. example_data &lt;- example_data %&gt;% rowwise() %&gt;% mutate(outcome = if_else(treatment == 0, rnorm(n = 1, mean = 5, sd = 1), rnorm(n = 1, mean = 6, sd = 1) ) ) example_data$treatment &lt;- as.factor(example_data$treatment) example_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = outcome, fill = treatment)) + geom_histogram(position = &quot;dodge&quot;, binwidth = 0.2) + theme_minimal() + labs(x = &quot;Outcome&quot;, y = &quot;Number of people&quot;, fill = &quot;Person was treated&quot;) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) example_regression &lt;- lm(outcome ~ treatment, data = example_data) tidy(example_regression) term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.043&nbsp; 116&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; treatment1 1.01 0.0625 16.1 5.14e-52 But then reality happens. Your experiment cannot run for too long otherwise people may be treated many times, or become inured to the treatment, but it cannot be too short otherwise you can’t measure longer term outcomes. You cannot have a ‘representative’ sample on every cross-tab, but if not then the treatment and control will be different. Practical difficulties may make it difficult to follow up with certain groups. Questions to ask (if they haven’t been answered already) include: How are the participants being selected into the frame for consideration? How are they being selected for treatment? We would hope this is a lottery, but this term is applied to a variety of situations. Additionally, early ‘success’ can lead to pressure to treat everyone. How is treatment being assessed? To what extent is random allocation ethical and fair? Some argue that shortages mean it is reasonable to randomly allocate, but that may depend on how linear the benefits are. It may also be difficult to establish boundaries. If we only want to include people in Ontario then that may be clear, but what about ‘students’ in Ontario - who is a student, and who is making the decision? Bias and other issues are not the end of the world. But you need to think about it carefully (Figure 27.1). Figure 27.1: A famous example of biased data Source: A variety of sources have this. In the example, Abraham Wald was given data on the planes that came back to Britain after being shot at in WW2. The question is where to place the armour. One option is to place it over the bullet holes. Wald recognised that there is a selection effect here - these are the planes that made it back - they didn’t need the armour, but instead we should put the armour where there were no bullet holes. To consider an example that may be closer to home - how would the results of a survey differ if I only asked students who completed this course what was difficult about it and not those who dropped out? While, as Dan suggests, we should work to try to make the dataset as good as possible, it may be possible to use the model to control for some of the bias. If there is a variable that is correlated with say, attrition, then we can add it to the model. Either by itself, or as an interaction. What if there is a correlation between the individuals? For instance, what if there were some ‘hidden variable’ that we didn’t know about, such as province, and it turned out that people from the same province were similar? In that case we could use ‘wider’ standard errors. But a better way to deal with this may be to change the experiment. For instance, we discussed stratified sampling - perhaps we should stratify by province? How would we implement this? Or we could try some of the methods that we will get to next. "],

What is great about their work? What could be improved? 28.1 Introduction The ideal situation, as described in the previous chapter, is rarely possible in a data science setting. Can we really reasonably expect that Netflix would allow us to change prices. And even if they did once, would they let us do it again, and again, and again? Further, rarely can we explicitly create treatment and control groups. Finally, experiments are really expensive and potentially unethical. Instead, we need to make do with what we have. Rather than our counterfactual coming to us through randomisation, and hence us knowing that the two are the same but for the treatment, we try to identify groups that were similar before the treatment, and hence any differences can be attributed to the treatment. In practice, we tend to even have differences between our two groups before we treat. Provided those pre-treatment differences satisfy some assumptions (basically that they were consistent, and we expect that consistency to continue in the absence of the treatment) – the ‘parallel trends’ assumption – then we can look to any difference in the differences as the effect of the treatment. One of the lovely aspects of difference in differences analysis is that we can do it using fairly straight-forward quantitative methods - linear regression with a dummy variable is all that is needed to do a convincing job. 28.2 Motivation Consider us wanting to know the effect of a new tennis racket on serve speed. One way to test this would be to measure the difference between Roger Federer’s serve speed without the tennis racket and mine with the tennis racket. Sure, we’d find a difference but how do we know how much to attribute to the tennis racket? Another way would be to consider the difference between my serve speed without the tennis racket and my serve speed with the tennis racket. But what if serves were just getting faster naturally over time? Instead, let’s combine the two to look at the difference in the differences! In this world we measure Federer’s serve and compare it to my serve without the new racket. We then measure Federer’s serve again and measure my serve with the new racket. That difference in the differences would then be our estimate of the effect of the new racket. What sorts of assumptions jump out at you that we are going to have to make in order for this analysis to be appropriate? Is there something else that may have affected only me, and not Roger that could affect my serve speed? Probably. e2) Is it likely that Roger Federer and I have the same trajectory of serve speed improvement? Probably not. This is the ‘parallel trends’ assumption, and it dominates any discussion of difference in differences analysis. Finally, is it likely that the variance of our serve speeds is the same? Probably not. Why might this be powerful? We don’t need the treatment and control group to be the same before the treatment. We just need to have a good idea of how they differ. 28.3 Simulated example Let’s generate some data. library(broom) library(tidyverse) set.seed(853) diff_in_diff_example_data &lt;- tibble(person = rep(c(1:1000), times = 2), time = c(rep(0, times = 1000), rep(1, times = 1000)), treatment_group = rep(sample(x = 0:1, size = 1000, replace = TRUE), times = 2) ) # We want to make the outcome slightly more likely if they were treated than if not. diff_in_diff_example_data &lt;- diff_in_diff_example_data %&gt;% rowwise() %&gt;% mutate(serve_speed = case_when( time == 0 &amp; treatment_group == 0 ~ rnorm(n = 1, mean = 5, sd = 1), time == 1 &amp; treatment_group == 0 ~ rnorm(n = 1, mean = 6, sd = 1), time == 0 &amp; treatment_group == 1 ~ rnorm(n = 1, mean = 8, sd = 1), time == 1 &amp; treatment_group == 1 ~ rnorm(n = 1, mean = 14, sd = 1), ) ) head(diff_in_diff_example_data) ## Source: local data frame [6 x 4] ## Groups: &lt;by row&gt; ## ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## person time treatment_group serve_speed ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 0 0 4.43 ## 2 2 0 1 6.96 ## 3 3 0 1 7.77 ## 4 4 0 0 5.31 ## 5 5 0 0 4.09 ## 6 6 0 0 4.85 Let’s make a graph. diff_in_diff_example_data$treatment_group &lt;- as.factor(diff_in_diff_example_data$treatment_group) diff_in_diff_example_data$time &lt;- as.factor(diff_in_diff_example_data$time) diff_in_diff_example_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = time, y = serve_speed, color = treatment_group)) + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(group = person), alpha = 0.2) + theme_minimal() + labs(x = &quot;Time period&quot;, y = &quot;Serve speed&quot;, color = &quot;Person got a new racket&quot;) + scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;) As it is a simple example, we could do this manually, by getting the average difference of the differences. average_differences &lt;- diff_in_diff_example_data %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = time, values_from = serve_speed, names_prefix = &quot;time_&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(difference = time_1 - time_0) %&gt;% group_by(treatment_group) %&gt;% summarise(average_difference = mean(difference)) average_differences$average_difference[2] - average_differences$average_difference[1] ## [1] 5.058414 Let’s use OLS to do the same analysis. The general regression equation is: \\[Y_{i,t} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\mbox{Treatment group dummy}_i + \\beta_2\\mbox{Time dummy}_t + \\beta_3(\\mbox{Treatment group dummy} \\times\\mbox{Time dummy})_{i,t} + \\epsilon_{i,t}\\] If we use * in the regression then it automatically includes the separate aspects as well as their interaction. It’s the estimate of \\(\\beta_3\\) which is of interest. diff_in_diff_example_regression &lt;- lm(serve_speed ~ treatment_group*time, data = diff_in_diff_example_data) tidy(diff_in_diff_example_regression) term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 4.97 0.0428 116&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; treatment_group1 3.03 0.0622 48.7 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time1 1.01 0.0605 16.6 2.97e-58 treatment_group1:time1 5.06 0.088&nbsp; 57.5 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, our estimates are the same! 28.4 Assumptions If we want to use difference in differences, then we need to satisfy the assumptions. There were three that were touched on earlier, but here I want to focus on one: the ‘parallel trends’ assumption. The parallel trends assumption haunts everything to do with diff-in-diff analysis because we can never prove it, we can just be convinced of it. To see why we can never prove it, consider an example in which we want to know the effect of a new stadium on a professional sports team’s wins/loses. To do this we consider two teams: the Warriors and the Raptors. The Warriors changed stadiums at the start of the 2019-20 season (the Raptors did not), so we will consider four time periods: the 2016-17 season, 2017-18 season, 2018-19 season, and finally we will compare the performance with the one after they moved, so in the 2019-20 season. The Raptors here act as our counterfactual. This means that we assume the relationship between the Warriors and the Raptors, in the absence of a new stadium, would have continued to change in a consistent way. But we can never know that for certain. We have to present sufficient evidence to assuage any concerns that a reader may have. For a variety of reasons, it is worth having tougher than normal requirements around the evidence it would take to convince you of an effect. There are four main ‘threats to validity’ when you are using difference in differences and you should address all of these (Cunningham, 2020, pp. 272–277): Non-parallel trends. The treatment and control groups may be based on differences. As such it can be difficult to convincingly argue for parallel trends. In this case, maybe try to find another factor to consider in your model that may adjust for some of that. This may require difference in difference in differences (in the earlier example, perhaps could add in the San Francisco 49ers as they are in the same broad geographic area as the Warriors). Or maybe re-think your analysis to see if you can make a different control group. Adding additional earlier time periods may help but may introduce more issues (see third point). Compositional differences. This is a concern when working with repeated cross-sections. What if the composition of those cross-sections change? For instance, if we work at Tik Tok or some other app that is rapidly growing and want to look at the effect of some change. In our initial cross-section, we may have mostly young people, but in a subsequent cross-section, we may have more older people as the demographics of the app usage change. Hence our results may just be an age-effect, not an effect of the change that we are interested in. Long-term effects vs. reliability. As we discussed in the last chapter, there is a trade-off between the length of the analysis that we run. As we run the analysis for longer there is more opportunity for other factors to affect the results. There is also increased chance for someone who was not treated to be treated. But, on the other hand, it can be difficult to convincingly argue that short-term results will continue in the long-term. Functional form dependence. This is less of an issue when the outcomes are similar, but if they are different then functional form may be responsible for some aspects of the results. 28.5 Matching This section draws on material from Gelman and Hill, 2007, pp. 207-212. Difference in differences is a powerful analysis framework. After I learnt about it I began to see opportunities to implement it everywhere. But it can be tough to identify appropriate treatment and control groups. In Alexander and Ward, 2018, we compare migrant brothers - one of whom had most of their education in a different country, and the other who had most of their education in the US. Is this really the best match? We may be able to match based on observable variables. For instance, age-group or education. At two different times we compare smoking rates in 18-year-olds in one city with smoking rates in 18-year-olds in another city. That is fine, but it is fairly coarse. We know that there are differences between 18-year-olds, even in terms of the variables that we commonly observe, say gender and education. One way to deal with this may be to create sub-groups: 18-year-old males with a high school education, etc. But the sample sizes are likely to quickly become small. How do we deal with continuous variables? And also, is the difference between an 18-year-old and a 19-year-old really so different? Shouldn’t we also compare with them? One way to proceed is to consider a nearest neighbour approach. But there is limited concern for uncertainty in this approach. There is also an issue if you have a large number of variables because you end up with a high-dimension graph. This leads us to propensity score matching. Propensity score matching involves assigning some probability to each observation. We construct that probability based on the observation’s values for the independent variables, at their values before the treatment. That probability is our best guess at the probability of the observation being treated, regardless of whether it was treated or not. For instance, if 18-year-old males were treated but 19-year-old males were not, then as there is not much difference between 18-year-old males and 19-year-old males our assigned probability would be fairly similar. We can then compare the outcomes of observations with similar propensity scores. One advantage of propensity score matching is that is allows us to easily consider many independent variables at once, and it can be constructed using logistic regression. Let’s generate some data to illustrate propensity score matching. Let’s pretend that we work for Amazon. We are going to treat some individuals with free-shipping to see what happens to their average purchase. library(tidyverse) sample_size &lt;- 10000 set.seed(853) amazon_purchase_data &lt;- tibble( unique_person_id = c(1:sample_size), age = runif(n = sample_size, min = 18, max = 100), city = sample( x = c(&quot;Toronto&quot;, &quot;Montreal&quot;, &quot;Calgary&quot;), size = sample_size, replace = TRUE ), gender = sample( x = c(&quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Other/decline&quot;), size = sample_size, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.49, 0.47, 0.02) ), income = rlnorm(n = sample_size, meanlog = 0.5, sdlog = 1) ) Now we need to add some probability of being treated with free shipping, which depends on our variables. Younger, higher-income, male and in Toronto all make it slightly more likely. amazon_purchase_data &lt;- amazon_purchase_data %&gt;% mutate(age_num = case_when( age &lt; 30 ~ 3, age &lt; 50 ~ 2, age &lt; 70 ~ 1, TRUE ~ 0), city_num = case_when( city == &quot;Toronto&quot; ~ 3, city == &quot;Montreal&quot; ~ 2, city == &quot;Calgary&quot; ~ 1, TRUE ~ 0), gender_num = case_when( gender == &quot;Male&quot; ~ 3, gender == &quot;Female&quot; ~ 2, gender == &quot;Other/decline&quot; ~ 1, TRUE ~ 0), income_num = case_when( income &gt; 3 ~ 3, income &gt; 2 ~ 2, income &gt; 1 ~ 1, TRUE ~ 0) ) %&gt;% rowwise() %&gt;% mutate(sum_num = sum(age_num, city_num, gender_num, income_num), softmax_prob = exp(sum_num)/exp(12), free_shipping = sample( x = c(0:1), size = 1, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-softmax_prob, softmax_prob) ) ) %&gt;% ungroup() amazon_purchase_data &lt;- amazon_purchase_data %&gt;% dplyr::select(-age_num, -city_num, -gender_num, -income_num, -sum_num, -softmax_prob) Finally, we need to have some measure of a person’s average spend. We want those with free shipping to be slightly higher than those without. amazon_purchase_data &lt;- amazon_purchase_data %&gt;% mutate(mean_spend = if_else(free_shipping == 1, 60, 50)) %&gt;% rowwise() %&gt;% mutate(average_spend = rnorm(1, mean_spend, sd = 5) ) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% dplyr::select(-mean_spend) # Fix the class on some amazon_purchase_data &lt;- amazon_purchase_data %&gt;% mutate_at(vars(city, gender, free_shipping), ~as.factor(.)) # Change some to factors table(amazon_purchase_data$free_shipping) ## ## 0 1 ## 9629 371 WHAT DO WE NEED TO ADD HERE?? Now we construct a logistic regression model that ‘explains’ whether a person was treated as a function of the variables that we think explain it. propensity_score &lt;- glm(free_shipping ~ age + city + gender + income, family = binomial, data = amazon_purchase_data) We will now add our forecast to our dataset. amazon_purchase_data &lt;- augment(propensity_score, data = amazon_purchase_data, type.predict = &quot;response&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::select(-.se.fit, -.resid, -.hat, -.sigma, -.cooksd, -.std.resid) Now we use our forecast to create matches. There are a variety of ways to do this. In a moment I’ll step through some code that does it all at once, but as this is a worked example and we only have a small number of possibilities, we can just do it manually. For every person who was actually treated (given free shipping) we want the untreated person who was considered as similar to them (based on propensity score) as possible. amazon_purchase_data &lt;- amazon_purchase_data %&gt;% arrange(.fitted, free_shipping) Here we’re going to use a matching function from the arm package. This finds which is the closest of the ones that were not treated, to each one that was treated. amazon_purchase_data$treated &lt;- if_else(amazon_purchase_data$free_shipping == 0, 0, 1) amazon_purchase_data$treated &lt;- as.integer(amazon_purchase_data$treated) matches &lt;- arm::matching(z = amazon_purchase_data$treated, score = amazon_purchase_data$.fitted) amazon_purchase_data &lt;- cbind(amazon_purchase_data, matches) Now we reduce the dataset to just those that are matched. We had 371 treated, so we expect a dataset of 742 observations. amazon_purchase_data_matched &lt;- amazon_purchase_data %&gt;% filter(matched != 0) %&gt;% dplyr::select(-matched, -pairs, -treated) WHAT DO WE NEED TO ADD HERE?? Finally, we can examine the ‘effect’ of being treated on average spend in the ‘usual’ way. propensity_score_regression &lt;- lm(average_spend ~ age + city + gender + income + free_shipping, data = amazon_purchase_data_matched) huxtable::huxreg(propensity_score_regression) (1) (Intercept) 49.694 *** (0.809)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age 0.005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (0.011)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cityMontreal 0.169&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (0.734)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cityToronto 0.652&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (0.623)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; genderMale -0.968 *&nbsp;&nbsp; (0.422)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; genderOther/decline -1.973&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2.621)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; income 0.009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (0.021)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free_shipping1 10.488 *** (0.380)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N 742&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R2 0.513&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; logLik -2267.486&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AIC 4552.971&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *** p &lt; 0.001; ** p &lt; 0.01; * p &lt; 0.05. I cover propensity score matching here because it is widely used. Hence, you need to know how to use it. People would think it’s weird if you didn’t, in the same way that we have to cover ANOVA people would think it’s weird if we had an entire experimental design course and didn’t cover it even though there are more modern ways of looking at differences between two means. But at the same time you need to know that there are flaws with propensity score matching. I will now discuss some of them. Matching. Propensity score matching cannot match on unobserved variables. This may be fine in a class-room setting, but in more realistic settings it will likely cause issues. Modelling. The results tend to be specific to the model that is used. King and Nielsen, 2019, discuss this thoroughly. Statistically. We are using the data twice. "],

Angelucci and Cagé, 2019, is a paper in which difference in differences is used to examine the effect of the reduction in advertising revenues on newspapers’ content and prices. They create a dataset of ‘French newspapers between 1960 and 1974’. They ‘perform a difference-in-differences analysis’ and exploit ‘the introduction of advertising on television’ as this change ‘affected national newspapers more severely than local ones’. They ‘find robust evidence of a decrease in the amount of journalistic-intensive content produced and the subscription price.’ In order to conduct this analysis we will use the dataset that they provide alongside their paper. This dataset is available at: https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/116438/version/V1/view. It is available for you to download after registration. As their dataset is in Stata data format, we will use the haven package to read it in (Wickham and Miller, 2019). library(here) library(haven) library(huxtable) library(scales) library(tidyverse) 29.2 Background Newspapers are in trouble. We can probably all think of a local newspaper that has closed recently because of pressure brought on by the internet. But this issue isn’t new. When television started, there were similar concerns. In this paper, Angelucci and Cagé use the introduction of television advertising in France, announced in 1967, to examine the effect of decreased advertising revenue on newspapers. The reason this is important is because it allows us to disentangle a few competing effects. For instance, are newspapers becoming redundant because they can no longer charge high prices for their ads or because consumers prefer to get their news in other ways? Are fewer journalists needed because smartphones and other technology mean they can be more productive? Angelucci and Cagé look at advertising revenue and a few other features, when a new advertising platform arrives, in this case television advertising. 29.3 Data (The) dataset contains annual data on local and national newspapers between 1960 and 1974, as well as detailed information on television content. In 1967, the French government announced it would relax long-standing regulations that prohibited television advertising. We provide evidence that this reform can be plausibly interpreted as an exogenous and negative shock to the advertising side of the newspaper industry… [I]t is likely that the introduction of television advertising constituted a direct shock to the advertising side of the newspaper industry and only an indirect shock to the reader side… (O)ur empirical setting constitutes a unique opportunity to isolate the consequences of a decrease in newspapers’ advertising revenues on their choices regarding the size of their newsroom, the amount of information to produce, and the prices they charge to both sides of the market. The authors’ argue that national newspapers were affected by the television advertising change, but local newspapers were not. So the national newspapers are the treatment group and the local newspapers are the control group. The dataset can be read in using read_dta(), which is a function within the haven package for reading in Stata dta files. This is equivalent to read_csv(). newspapers &lt;- read_dta(here::here(&quot;inputs/data/116438-V1/data/dta/Angelucci_Cage_AEJMicro_dataset.dta&quot;)) dim(newspapers) ## [1] 1196 52 There are 1,196 observations in the dataset and 52 variables. The authors are interested in the 1960-1974 time period which has around 100 newspapers. There are 14 national newspapers at the beginning of the period and 12 at the end. We just want to replicate their main results, so we don’t need all their variables. As such we will just select() the ones that we are interested in and change the class() where needed. newspapers &lt;- newspapers %&gt;% dplyr::select(year, id_news, after_national, local, national, # Diff in diff variables ra_cst, qtotal, ads_p4_cst, ads_s, # Advertising side dependents ps_cst, po_cst, qtotal, qs_s, rs_cst) %&gt;% #Reader side dependents mutate(ra_cst_div_qtotal = ra_cst / qtotal) %&gt;% # One of the advertising side dependents needs ot be built mutate_at(vars(id_news, after_national, local, national), ~as.factor(.)) %&gt;% # Change some to factors mutate(year = as.integer(year)) We can now have a look at the main variables of interest for both national (Figure 29.1) and local daily newspapers (Figure 29.2).

What are some features of this package that may be useful in your own work? What do you think about using COVID-19 in an RDD setting? Statistically? Ethically? 31.1 Introduction Regression discontinuity design (RDD) is a popular way to get causality when there is some continuous variable with cut-offs that determine treatment. Is there a difference between a student who gets 79 per cent and a student who gets 80 per cent? Probably not much, but one gets an A-, while the other gets a B+, and seeing that on a transcript could affect who gets a job which could affect income. In this case the percentage is a ‘forcing variable’ and the cut-off for an A- is a ‘threshold’. As the treatment is determined by the forcing variable all you need to do is to control for that variable. And, these seemingly arbitrary cut-offs can be seen all the time. Hence, there has been an ‘explosion’ in the use of regression discontinuity design (Figure 31.1). Please note that I’ve followed the terminology of Taddy, 2019. Gelman and Hill, 2007, and others use slightly different terminology. For instance, Cunningham refers to the forcing function as the running variable. It doesn’t matter what you use so long as you are consistent. If you have a terminology that you are familiar with then please feel free to use it, and to share it with me! Figure 31.1: The explosion of regression discontinuity designs in recent years. Source: John Holbein, 13 February 2020. The key assumptions are: The cut-off is ‘known, precise and free of manipulation’ (Cunningham, 2020, p. 163). The forcing function should be continuous because this means we can say that people on either side of the threshold are the same, other than happening to just fall on either side of the threshold. 31.2 Simulated example Let’s generate some data. library(broom) library(tidyverse) set.seed(853) number_of_observation &lt;- 1000 rdd_example_data &lt;- tibble(person = c(1:number_of_observation), grade = runif(number_of_observation, min = 78, max = 82), income = rnorm(number_of_observation, 10, 1) ) # We want to make an accident more likely if they are grade 21 and over rdd_example_data &lt;- rdd_example_data %&gt;% mutate(income = if_else(grade &gt; 80, income + 2, income)) head(rdd_example_data) person grade income 1 79.4 9.43 2 78.5 9.69 3 79.9 10.8&nbsp; 4 79.3 9.34 5 78.1 10.7&nbsp; 6 79.6 9.83 Let’s make a graph. rdd_example_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = grade, y = income)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + geom_smooth(data = rdd_example_data %&gt;% filter(grade &lt; 80), method=&#39;lm&#39;, color = &quot;black&quot;) + geom_smooth(data = rdd_example_data %&gt;% filter(grade &gt;= 80), method=&#39;lm&#39;, color = &quot;black&quot;) + theme_minimal() + labs(x = &quot;Grade&quot;, y = &quot;Income ($)&quot;) We can use a dummy variable with linear regression to estimate the effect (we’re hoping that it’s 2 because that is what we imposed.) rdd_example_data &lt;- rdd_example_data %&gt;% mutate(grade_21_and_over = if_else(grade &lt; 80, 0, 1)) lm(income ~ grade + grade_21_and_over, data = rdd_example_data) %&gt;% tidy() term estimate std.error statistic p.value (Intercept) 11.7&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.24&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.76&nbsp; 0.00585&nbsp; grade -0.021 0.0537 -0.391 0.696&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grade_21_and_over 1.99&nbsp; 0.123&nbsp; 16.2&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.34e-52 There are various caveats to this estimate that we’ll get into later, but the essentials are here. The other great thing about regression discontinuity is that is can almost be as good as an RCT. For instance, (and I thank John Holbein for the pointer) Bloom, Bell, and Reiman (2020) compare randomized trials with RCTs and find that the RCTs compare favourably. 31.2.1 Different slopes (Figure 31.2) Figure 31.2: Effect of minimum unit pricing for alcohol in Scotland. Source: John Burn-Murdoch, 7 February 2020. 31.3 Overlap In the randomised control trial and A/B testing section, because of randomised assignment of the treatment, we imposed that the control and treatment groups were the same but for the treatment. We moved to difference-in-differences, and we assumed that there was a common trend between the treated and control groups. We allowed that the groups could be different, but that we could ‘difference out’ their differences. Finally, we considered matching, and we said that even if we the control and treatment groups seemed quite different we were able to match those who were treated with a group that were similar to them in all ways, apart from the fact that they were not treated. In regression discontinuity we consider a slightly different setting - the two groups are completely different in terms of the forcing variable - they are on either side of the threshold. So there is no overlap at all. But we know the threshold and believe that those on either side are essentially matched. Let’s consider the 2019 NBA Eastern Conference Semifinals - Toronto and the Philadelphia. Game 1: Raptors win 108-95; Game 2: 76ers win 94-89; Game 3: 76ers win 116-95; Game 4: Raptors win 101-96; Game 5: Raptors win 125-89; Game 6: 76ers win 112-101; and finally, Game 7: Raptors win 92-90, because of a ball that win in after bouncing on the rim four times. Was there really that much difference between the teams (Figure 31.3)? Figure 31.3: It took four bounces to go in, so how different were the teams…? Source: Stan Behal / Postmedia Network. 31.4 Examples As with difference-in-differences, after I learnt about it, I began to see opportunities to implement it everywhere. Frankly, I find it a lot easier to think of legitimate examples of using regression discontinuity than difference-in-differences. But, at the risk of mentioning yet another movie from the 1990s that none of you have seen, when I think of RDD, my first thought is often of Sliding Doors (Figure 31.4). Figure 31.4: Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition. Source: Mlotek, Haley, 2018, ‘The Almosts and What-ifs of ’Sliding Doors’’, The Ringer, 24 April, freely available at: https://www.theringer.com/movies/2018/4/24/17261506/sliding-doors-20th-anniversary. Not only did the movie have a great soundtrack and help propel Gwyneth Paltrow to super-stardom, but it features an iconic moment in which Paltrow’s character, Helen, arrives at a tube station at which point the movie splits into two. In one version she just makes the train, and arrives home to find her boyfriend cheating on her; and in another she just misses the train and doesn’t find out about the boyfriend. I’d say, spoiler alert, but the movie was released in 1998, so… Of course, that ‘threshold’ turns out to be important. In the world in which she gets the train she leaves the boyfriend, cuts her hair, and changes everything about her life. In the world in which she misses the train she doesn’t. At least initially. But, and I can’t say this any better than Ashley Fetters: At the end of Sliding Doors, the “bad” version of Helen’s life elides right into the “good” version; even in the “bad” version, the philandering !@#$%^&amp; boyfriend eventually gets found out and dumped, the true love eventually gets met-cute, and the MVP friend comes through. According to the Sliding Doors philosophy, in other words, even when our lives take fluky, chaotic detours, ultimately good-hearted people find each other, and the bad boyfriends and home-wreckers of the world get their comeuppance. There’s no freak turn of events that allows the cheating boyfriend to just keep cheating, or the well-meaning, morally upright soulmates to just keep floating around in the universe unacquainted. Fetters, Ashley, 2018, ‘I Think About This a Lot: The Sliding Doors in Sliding Doors’, The Cut, 9 April, freely available at: https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/i-think-about-this-a-lot-the-sliding-doors-in-sliding-doors.html. I’m getting off-track here, but the point is, not only does it seem as though we have a ‘threshold’, but it seems as though there’s continuity! Let’s see some more legitimate implementations of regression discontinuity. (And thank you to Ryan Edwards for pointing me to these.) 31.4.1 Elections Elections are a common area of application for regression discontinuity because if the election is close then arguably there’s not much difference between the candidates. There are plenty of examples of regression discontinuity in an elections setting, but one recent one is George, Siddharth Eapen, 2019, ‘Like Father, Like Son? The Effect of Political Dynasties on Economic Development’, freely available at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/orhvh3n03wd9ybl/sid_JMP_dynasties_latestdraft.pdf?dl=0. In this paper George is interested in political dynasties. But is the child of a politician more likely to be elected because they are the child of a politician, or because they happen to also be similarly skilled at politics? Regression discontinuity can help because in a close election, we can look at differences between places where someone narrowly won with where a similar someone narrowly lost. In the George, 2019, case he examines: descendant effects using a close elections regression discontinuity (RD) design. We focus on close races between dynastic descendants (i.e. direct relatives of former officeholders) and non-dynasts, and we compare places where a descendant narrowly won to those where a descendant narrowly lost. In these elections, descendants and non-dynasts have similar demographic and political characteristics, and win in similar places and at similar rates. Nevertheless, we find negative economic effects when a descendant narrowly wins. Villages represented by a descendant have lower asset ownership and public good provision after an electoral term: households are less likely to live in a brick house and to own basic amenities like a refrigerator, mobile phone, or vehicle. Moreover, voters assess descendants to perform worse in office. An additional standard deviation of exposure to descendants lowers a village’s wealth rank by 12pp. The model that George, 2019, estimates is (p. 19: \\[y_i = \\alpha_{\\mbox{district}} + \\beta \\times \\mbox{Years descendant rule}_i + f(\\mbox{Descendant margin}) + \\gamma X_i + \\epsilon_{i,t}.\\] In this model, \\(y_i\\) is various development outcomes in village \\(i\\); \\(\\mbox{Years descendant rule}_i\\) is the number of years a dynastic descendant has represented village \\(i\\) in the national or state parliament; \\(\\mbox{Descendant margin}\\) is the vote share difference between the dynastic descendant and non-dynast; and \\(\\gamma X_i\\) is a vector of village-level adjustments. George, 2019, then conducts a whole bunch of tests of the validity of the regression discontinuity design (p. 19). These are critical in order for the results to be believed. There are a lot of different results but one is shown in Figure 31.5. Figure 31.5: George, 2019, descendant effects identified using close elections RD design (p. 41). 31.4.2 Economic development One of the issues with considering economic development is that a place typically is either subject to some treatment or not. However, sometimes regression discontinuity allows us to compare areas that were just barely treated with those that were just barely not. One recent paper that does this Esteban Mendez-Chacon and Diana Van Patten, 2020, ‘Multinationals, monopsony and local development: Evidence from the United Fruit Company’ available here: https://www.dianavanpatten.com/. They are interested in the effect of the United Fruit Company (UFCo), which was given land in Costa Rica between 1889 and 1984. They were given roughly 4 per cent of the national territory or around 4500 acres. They key is that this land assignment was redrawn in 1904 based on a river and hence the re-assignment was essentially random with regard to determinants of growth to that point. They compare areas that were assigned to UFCo with those that were not. They find: We find that the firm had a positive and persistent effect on living standards. Regions within the UFCo were 26 per cent less likely to be poor in 1973 than nearby counterfactual locations, with only 63 per cent of the gap closing over the following three decades. Company documents explain that a key concern at the time was to attract and maintain a sizable workforce, which induced the firm to invest heavily in local amenities that likely account for our result. The model is: \\[y_{i,g,t} = \\gamma\\mbox{UFCo}_g + f(\\mbox{geographic location}_g) + X_{i,g,t}\\beta + X_g\\Gamma + \\alpha_t + \\epsilon_{i,g,t}.\\] In this model, \\(y_{i,g,t}\\) is the development outcome for a household \\(i\\) in census-block \\(g\\) and year \\(t\\); \\(\\gamma\\mbox{UFCo}_g\\) is an indicator variable as to whether the census-block was in a UFCo area or not; \\(f(\\mbox{geographic location}_g)\\) is a function of the latitude and longitude to adjust for geographic area; \\(X_{i,g,t}\\) is covariates for household \\(i\\); \\(X_g\\) is geographic characteristics for that census-block; and \\(\\alpha_t\\) is a year fixed effect. Again, there are a lot of different results but one is shown in Figure 31.6. Figure 31.6: George, 2020, UFCo effect on the probability of being poor (p. 17). 31.5 Implementation Although they are fairly conceptually similar to work that we have done in the past, if you are wanting to use regression discontinuity in your work then you might like to consider a specialised package. The package rdrobust is a one recommendation, although there are others available and you should try those if you are interested. (The rdd package had been the go-to for a while, but seems to have been taken off CRAN recently. If you use RDD, then maybe just follow up to see if it comes back on as that one is pretty nice.) Let’s look at our example using rdrobust. library(rdrobust) rdrobust(y = rdd_example_data$income, x = rdd_example_data$grade, c = 80, h = 2, all = TRUE) %&gt;% summary() ## Call: rdrobust ## ## Number of Obs. 1000 ## BW type Manual ## Kernel Triangular ## VCE method NN ## ## Number of Obs. 497 503 ## Eff.

That is, the threshold is strict. However, in reality, often the boundary is a little less strict. For instance, consider the drinking age. Although there is a legal drinking age, say 19. If we looked at the number of people who had drank, then it’s likely to increase in the few years leading up to that age. Perhaps you went to Australia where the drinking age is 18 and drank. Or perhaps you snuck into a bar when you were 17, etc. In a sharp RDD setting, if you know the value of the forcing function then you know the outcome. For instance, if you get a grade of 80 then we know that you got an A-, but if you got a grade of 79 then we know that you got a B+. But with fuzzy RDD it is only known with some probability. We can say that a Canadian 19-year-old is more likely to have drunk alcohol than a Canadian 18 year old, but the number of Canadian 18-year-olds who have drunk alcohol is not zero. It may be possible to deal with fuzzy RDD settings with appropriate choice of model or data. It may also be possible to deal with them using instrumental variables, which we cover in the next section. 31.7 Threats to validity The continuity assumption is fairly important, but we cannot test this as it is based on a counterfactual. Instead we need to convince people of it. Ways to do this include: Using a test/train set-up. Trying different specifications (and be very careful if your results don’t broadly persist when just consider linear or quadratic functions). Considering different subsets of the data. Consider different windows. Be up-front about uncertainty intervals, especially in graphs. Discuss and assuage concerns about the possibility of omitted variables. The threshold is also important. For instance, is there an actual shift or is there a non-linear relationship? We want as ‘sharp’ an effect as possible, but if the thresholds are known, then they will be gamed. For instance, there is a lot of evidence that people run for certain marathon times, and we know that people aim for certain grades. Similarly, from the other side, it is a lot easier for an instructor to just give out As than it is to have to justify Bs. One way to look at this is to consider how ‘balanced’ the sample is on either side of the threshold. Do this by using histograms with appropriate bins, for instance Figure 31.7, which is from Allen et al. (2017). Figure 31.7: Bunching around marathon times. 31.8 Weaknesses External validity may be hard - think about the A-/B+ example - do you think the findings generalise to B-/C+? The important responses are those that are close to the cut-off. So even if we have a whole bunch of B- and A+ students, they don’t really help much. Hence we need a lot of data. There is a lot of freedom for the researcher, so open science best practice becomes vital. References "],
