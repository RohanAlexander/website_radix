`AustralianPoliticians` is an R package that consists of a collection of datasets related to Australian politicians.

The datasets are:

* **all.rda**: The main dataset. 
* **by_division_mps.rda**: Adds information about the division ('seat') of the politician. 
* **by_party.rda**: Adds information about the party of the politician. 
* **by_state_senators.rda**: Adds information about the state that a senator was representing.
* **list_prime_ministers.rda**: Whether the politician was prime minister. 
* **uniqueID_to_aphID.rda**: A correspondence between the uniqueIDs used in these datasets and the IDs used by the Australian Parliament House.
