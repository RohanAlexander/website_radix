`AustralianPoliticians` is an R package that consists of a collection of datasets related to Australian politicians.

The datasets are:

* **all.rda**: The main dataset.
* **by_division_mps.rda**: Adds information about the division (‘seat’) of the politician.
* **by_party.rda**: Adds information about the party of the politician.
* **by_state_senators.rda**: Adds information about the state that a senator was representing.
* **cabinet.rda**: A provisional dataset of who was in the cabinet.
* **ministry.rda**: A provisional dataset of who was in the ministry
* **uniqueID_to_aphID.rda**: A correspondence between the uniqueIDs used in these datasets and the IDs used by the Australian Parliament House.

In general, the datasets are up-to-date as of 30 November 2019 (i.e. they include the deaths of Fisher, Darling and Humphreys; the appointments of Henderson and Molan; and Sinodinos’ retirement).

The ministry and cabinets datasets are up-to-date as of 2017. I have not yet updated to include Morrison.

If you are using this for anything other than general interest, then please check the comments column in case there is a flag that could affect your results. You’re also more than welcome to get in touch so that I can make sure that the aspect you’re interested in is of a good enough quality for your purposes, or how we can make it better.

If you have suggestions on how I could improve the datasets, or corrections, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.

You can install the pacakge from GitHub, and more information is available [there](https://github.com/RohanAlexander/AustralianPoliticians).
